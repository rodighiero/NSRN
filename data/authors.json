Modeling Pathways of Unbelief Across Cultural Contexts This presentation will address both of the major questions guiding the “Cultures of Unbelief” conference by outlining the conceptual architectures and initial experimental findings of two computational models of unbelief. Social simulation techniques of the sort to be described here enable researchers to test hypotheses about the ways in which micro-level psychological variables and individual behaviors (such as levels of unbelief and affiliation with in-groups that exclude believers) can lead to the emergence of macro-level sociological phenomena at the population level (such as demographic changes related to unbelief and group affiliation). By constructing simulated agents with psychologically realistic cognitive architectures (and individual variables such as class, age, gender and education) who interact within an “artificial society,” and validating those interactions in light of real-world data sets, researchers can run experiments that explore how different cultural contextual conditions (parameters) can alter the pathways through which individual agents alter their religious beliefs and behaviors. And this is exactly what our research teams have done. At last year’s conference in London, we offered an introduction to the relevant models, which were just underway. Our presentation at the NSRN conference was featured in the most recent issue of Der Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/glaube-was-haelt-religionen-zusammen-was-schwaecht-sie-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000161665903. In the currently proposed paper, we would like to present an update on two models that are directly relevant to the conference theme. The first is a systems-dynamics model of the “analytic” pathway to atheism, which includes parameters that allow us to test how contextual factors (such as presence of religion in the environment) impact this pathway. The second is an agent-based model of CRED theory. In the latter, agents have variables such as gender, education, employment, etc., as well as “worldviews” (religious or nonreligious). We will present the architectures and our initial findings, which help to shed light on “the nature of unbelief” and “the ways in which different types of unbelief” shift across cultural contexts. Analyzing Analytic Worldviews: Particularizing Nonreligion through Computational Modeling and Simulation The proposed paper will present a computational model of the conditions under which – and the mechanisms by which – more individuals within a population engage in critically reflective, naturalistic explanations of the world. The authors (see below) are part of a broader project that is developing a series of computer simulations designed to shed light on the causes and effects of atheism, as well as the dynamics within and pathways toward nonreligious worldviews. We operationalize the latter as involving attempts to make sense of the world and act sensibly within society without appealing to supernatural agents and authorities. The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts. We hope to show how our model can be utilized to test hypotheses that derive from a host of disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and religious studies.

This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people.

Myth and Solidarity in the Modern World: An Introduction The world is awash with myths and fake news. The gut consensus among university-educated, post-Enlightenment minds appears to be that we should do away with myths altogether. But what about the positive role that myths play in underwriting shared action? My book, Myth and Solidarity in the Modern World: Beyond Religious and Political Division, sheds light on this positive role and how groups are facilitating the inclusive sharing of myths in diverse spaces. The following is a short introduction to that book.  How the nonreligious live Christmas In this Christmas blog special, NSRN editors     and     share and reflect upon the narratives of how six nonreligious people navigate through the festive period.

		"text": "Going Godless: Black Feminism, Humanism, and Anti-Racism According to a 2012 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation Survey, 87% of African American women are religious, making African American women among the most religious demographic groups in the U.S. Although Black women have long been stereotyped as the “backbone” of the Black Church, some Black women non-theists and humanists are bucking these traditions to challenge organized religion. Historically, Black women have relied on churches and faith-based institutions as vehicles for political organizing, cultural identity, and community solidarity. It is for this reason, as well as the slave-era stigma associated with Black female sexuality, that being a Black female humanist and atheist is even more taboo than being a Black male atheist. Dehumanized as either hyper-sexual Jezebels or asexual Aunt Jemimas, Black women have been constructed as less moral, less human, less chaste, and less civilized than respectable white Christian women. “Going Godless” will examine this history vis-à-vis the emergence of Black feminist humanist perspectives in the American secular humanist and atheist movements. For example, how have Black women humanists and atheists drawn on the feminist/womanist legacy of writers and thinkers like Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Nella Larsen? How are they challenging the traditional church/state separation agenda of the mainstream atheist/humanist movements? And what intersectional issues inform a Black feminist humanist political agenda as racial, gender, and socioeconomic inequality intensifies in the U.S.? ",

Drawing on extensive survey data in the United States and Canada, as well as interview data with thirty religious nones in Calgary, Canada, we offer a sociological exploration into the heterogeneity among religious nones in North America. We focus on a continuum of five types of nones, based on the dimensions of belief and behaviour: involved seculars, inactive non-believers, inactive believers, spiritual but not religious, and church involved believers. In doing so, we examine the diversity of relationships that religious nones’ have or do not have with organized religion, personalized or group spiritualties, non-religion and non-belief, as well as organized secular communities. We give attention to how and why these respective groups have grown or declined over time, as well as where and why they are strongly or weakly represented (nationally and regionally).

We focus on a continuum of five types of nones, based on the dimensions of belief and behaviour: involved seculars, inactive non-believers, inactive believers, spiritual but not religious, and church involved believers. In doing so, we examine the diversity of relationships that religious nones’ have or do not have with organized religion, personalized or group spiritualties, non-religion and non-belief, as well as organized secular communities. We give attention to how and why these respective groups have grown or declined over time, as well as where and why they are strongly or weakly represented (nationally and regionally). Subtypes of Religious Nones in the United States and Canada In this post     and     updates us on their 2 year project which aims to answer what the difference is between 'nones’ in the US and Canada. The Meaning of Sunday: The Practice of Belief in a Secular Age … Continuing the Conversation In this blog post, sociologist     follows up on his previous NSRN contribution “Religious Nones in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration” which previewed the findings of his newest book The Meaning of Sunday: The Practice of Belief in a Secular Age. Since its release,   has continued to interpret these findings through “author-meets-critics” sessions at some major conferences. Below, he charts some of the most provocative questions coming out of those sessions, whose as-yet-unknown answers might steer where our knowledge of Canadian nones goes next. Kids, You Make the Choice: Religious and Secular Socialization among Marginal Affiliates and Nonreligious Individuals What approaches do parents or those who plan to have children employ to socialize their children about religious or secular identification, beliefs, and practices? In what ways do primary and secondary socialization agents interact in this process? How might cultural narratives shape or be shaped by primary and secondary socialization activities? I address these questions by drawing on sixty interviews with two groups of Canadians – those who identify with a Christian group but limit attendance to religious holidays and rites of passage (marginal affiliates), and those who do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services (nonreligious individuals). I found that marginal affiliates did or planned to expose their children to religious belief and practice, while nonreligious individuals were inclined to defer to their children. However, marginal affiliates and nonreligious individuals jointly maintained that children should have choice in this matter. Parents did not or planned not to impose religious or secular views on children. Further, one’s upbringing informed parental socialization strategies and tactics that were largely informed by prevailing Canadian cultural narratives. Religious Nones in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration In this post     discusses his research with religious nones in the Canadian context. The post includes a discussion of the perceived benefits of such a position, and how his research participants describe finding meaning and purpose in their lives.  Religious Nones in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration Similar to many other modern Western nations, religious nones are growing rapidly in Canada. Religious nones represent onequarter of Canadian adults and one-third of Canadian teens today yet little is known empirically about this group in the Canadian context. Drawing on thirty interviews with religious nones, this paper explores some of the perceived benefits for identifying as a religious none, their beliefs about the supernatural, about meaning and purpose in life as well as the afterlife, about morality, and their aversion to religion that is forced on to others. Amidst their varied views on the supernatural and the afterlife, overall most religious nones believe that they are free and openminded relative to those who are deeply religious, they believe that they have meaning and purpose in life, they reject the assertion that humans need religion to be moral, and they adamantly oppose those who force their religion on to others – and this includes religious nones who do not believe that they ought to convince others to also become religious nones. In total these findings resonate with a pervasive and growing Canadian secular ethos that rejects exclusive belief systems, prides itself on the stance that religion is an individual and private matter, and opposes forcing one’s beliefs on to another – all in the name of protecting cultural ideals of diversity, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism.

		"text": "Is Mindfulness a Religion for Unbelievers? In this blog,     shares some qualitative findings from a longitudinal mixed-methods study exploring the diversity of unbelief in the mindfulness subcultures of the UK and the US. Understanding unbelief in the mindfulness subculture Mindfulness meditation has entered the British and American mainstream culture as a secular, scientific technique that supports both physical and mental health. Consequential to its secular framing, mindfulness has been particularly appealing to non-religious peoples who seek out this practice as means to improve their well-being. Yet, for many people, Mindfulness can become more than a mere technique; it can become a major source of meaning in their lives, informing their values, reshaping their self-concept, and even altering their conceptions of the world and their relations with transcendent realities. This paper draws on in-depth and longitudinal interviews with meditators in the UK and the US to explore the range of non-believer identities and outlooks that are constituted in the Mindfulness subculture. In particular, it traces the influence of the practice on the meditators’ worldviews, asking: To what extent, and in which direction, does the practice steer the trajectory of their lives? It then depicts the common patterns of change in the nonreligious outlooks – such as transit from positive atheism to secular Buddhism and strong agnosticism – as they increase their engagement with Mindfulness and its teachings. Linguistic structures behind ambiguous non-Buddhist, nonreligious identities The contemporary religious landscape is characterized by the rise of networks of individuals who experience the world from a position of “unbelief.” Within this context, meditation movements that promote Buddhist worldviews and practices, repackaged in a scientific and world-affirming language, constitute a fertile subculture within which diverse manifestations of unbelief are constructed and maintained. Self-declared 'nones,’ with little or no interest in Buddhist scripture, ethics, or cosmology, attend meditation courses, sit cross-legged in silence, and devote countless hours to an introspective process traditionally designed to lead the meditator to enlightenment. This presentation scrutinize the underlying linguistic strategies and cultural dispositions that lead to a disconnection between “non-religious” self-identifications and representations of selves that are constructed and interpreted within a particular religious language. It is based on my ethnographic research and in-depth interviews with practitioners of (1) Vipassana meditation in New Zealand and (2) Mindfulness Meditation in the UK. ",

		"text": "The Final Sentence of Section #151 in Adorno’s Minima Moralia Adorno’s post-World War II statement that 'No spirit exists’, posited at the conclusion of an essay, provides a crucial window into considerations of modern atheism as well as contemporary anatheism. His utterance occurs historically about half-way between Nietzsche’s infamous declaration of the death of God and these two modern phenomena. His short sentence draws some of its meaning from its immediate context (his essay against occultism), but also from its broader context, the Hegelian notion of the World Spirit. Most significantly, though, it is a highly prescient insight, baldly formulated, and arguably more far-reaching than the madman’s 'God is dead.’ References are made to various thinkers in the past two hundred years to elucidate some of the possible nuances of Adorno’s statement. Both modern atheism and contemporary anatheism can be illuminated as pivoting around Adorno’s shrewd observation. ",

		"text": "The Meaning of 'Secular’ as a Scientific Concept The meaning of 'secular’ in the scientific use of 'secular trend’, 'secular variation’, and similar terms is a topic that merits historical investigation. The scientific meaning for 'secular’ has an origin and independent role apart from both religion and secularization. Fields in the social sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences have been using the concepts of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ for almost two centuries. The field of economics was the first among the social sciences, while epidemiology was the first in the life sciences. Both disciplines adapted the use of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ from the earth sciences, which borrowed the idea of 'secular’ from astronomy. Early astronomical texts first used 'secular’ to describe 'secular inequalities’ and 'secular variations’ in long-term patterns to celestial motions. Astronomers had found saeculum to be a convenient Latin word from ancient Rome to refer to a century’s duration. This article recounts the intellectual history of the scientific uses, which continue to lack a relationship with anything religious to the present day. Polysecularity and Types of Nonbelief: Framing the Field of Secular Studies The affirmative commitments of nonreligious people leave them generally uninterested in personal religiosity, and keep them at relative distance apart from organized religions. This nonreligiosity is poorly characterized in terms of some “religious deficit” model, as if nonreligiosity should be framed by cognitive/ affective disabilities to be religious (e.g. a deficit in mentalization or theory of mind). Nor should nonreligiosity be framed in terms of any “religious aversion” model, supposing that the nonreligious person suffers from compulsive aversions to religion’s communal, compliance, or character demands. The establishment and development of Secular Studies has been obstructed by theological stereotypes for the nonreligious: the 'secular’ involves insensitivity or impassivity to religious wonders, or secularity is the realm of rudely materialistic and utilitarian matters, or secularity may be a manifestation of 'anti-religious’ antagonisms. Fair research into the thoughts and motives of nonreligious people should instead begin with them in their own lived worlds, not just contrasted against idealized theological portraits of religious people in theirs. Secularity should no longer be conceptualized solely in terms of regrettable deviations from hegemonic theological norms. The enjoyment of rewarding worldly pursuits, the concern for sound social relationships, and the engagement with important civic issues are prominent modes of functional secular living displayed across historical time periods and civilizations. I have labeled this broadly historical and global phenomenon as 'polysecularity’, suitable for multidisciplinary investigation. The world’s highways are not all roads going away from Rome; worldly pursuits are not all flights heading away from religion. ",

Increasing Diversity in Emerging Non-religious Communities Contemporary growth in non-religious populations has given rise to novel communities with unique perspectives on social issues. We describe a study of diversity within speakers at conferences organised by and attended by the atheist community. We analyse trends in diversity of 630 speakers, corresponding to 1223 speaking slots at 48 conferences conducted for the purpose of discussing or espousing non-religious views over the period 2003–2014. Diversity among speakers (defined using multivariate statistics in terms of the representation of women and non-white people) increased significantly over time during the period studied. This broadening participation may have arisen from interventions to address issues of representation or may simply reflect a generational shift in the demographics of the community. However, on-going problems with data collection and the imbalance in the social cost of identifying as non-religious between different social groups continue to impede efforts to reduce barriers to equality within this growing movement.

		"text": "Beneath the Surface: A Critique of the Common Survey Model in the Study of Nonreligion When measuring nonreligiosity, a common approach is to ask about the participants’ religious or nonreligious affiliation and belief in God. In this critical commentary, this type of methodological approach – referred as the “survey model” – is first placed in its historical context. The article suggests that understanding the historical context and cultural function of the survey model illuminates various theoretical and methodological limitations that have been previously recognized in multiple areas of research from the study of religion and sociology to survey methodology and cognitive sciences. Based on this interdisciplinary review, it is noted that, if relying on the survey model in either qualitative or quantitative research, the studies are likely to sustain the cultural categories of “religion” and “nonreligion” that, paradoxically, are implicitly defined by the survey model, and remain at the level of reputation management. To overcome these limitations and allowing researchers to assess cultural and cognitive aspects of the forming and construing of a human phenomenon like nonreligiosity, the article emphasizes the importance of multimethodology along with an interdisciplinary theoretical framework. Measuring Implicit Religious and Nonreligious Belief In the first of the SSNB/NSRN Methods Blog series,     introduces us to methods for researching, not the religious-like and religion-related beliefs we consciously think we hold, but the ones we unconsciously hold – which work to shape our attitudes, behaviours and relationships with others beneath our awareness.

		"text": "Practicing without believing? Expressions of sacred in human relationships amongst Japanese unbelievers: its consistency and inconsistency Ama (1996) among others explain an enigma between Japanese expressions of religious unbelief and participation in religious rituals in a context where they do not associate such participation with religion, but with more generic terms such as culture, tradition, custom or event. My interviews support their claim; they make sense of their contradictions in a similar narrative. Although this might signal absence of strong belief in religion or, even culture, my research also highlights a variety of more committed beliefs in relationships with people around them, such as family, children, neighbours and humanity in general. For example, whilst some immediately reject existence of angels, ghosts or spirits of gods, they hesitate to do so with spirits of ancestors because such rejection seems disrespectful even if they admit that they only believe in what they can actually see. A belief in relationships generates a particular kind of narratives when they negotiate different values in complex moral and political questions, forming distinctive godless ethics, mostly in a consistent way with their belief in human relationships over gods, but sometimes inconsistently. “Non-event” report: Why the Sunday Assembly event did not launch in Japan In this post,     and     explore what we can learn from the absence of the Sunday Assembly [SA] in Japan, despite some interest in setting it up. What can a lack of interest in a Japanese SA tell us about the SA framework and/or the Japanese relationship to organised religion?  ",

		"text": "The nature and experience of non-belief for older-adults This paper will discuss the early findings and analysis of my ongoing doctoral research which is exploring the nature and experience of non-belief for older-adults in the UK. Specifically, the research investigates the life histories of older-adults in relation to their non-belief (including their backgrounds, childhood, religious background), the stability of non-belief, the significance and expression of non-belief in older adults’ everyday lives, as well as pinpointing and shedding light on what non-believing older-adults do believe in, examining alternative beliefs and the potential existence of non-believing and non-religious cultures. Insights into the Experiences, Stability and Nature of Unbelief for Older Adults in the UK: Regional Perspectives This paper will discuss the role that regional specificity plays in the experience, understanding and significance of unbelief for older adults living in the UK. Voas and McAndrew’s (2012) research 'Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain’ coins the phrase 'microclimates’ to highlight the disparities found across Britain when looking at Census data on religious affiliation. By taking a regional specific approach the research hopes to uncover whether the non-religiosity of older adults differs depending on the region in which they live and/or grew up as well as taking into account other intersectional influences in their lives. This paper draws on of ongoing doctoral research which will qualitatively explore the nature of unbelief for older adults from a range of different ethnic and social backgrounds, and who do not participate in a nonreligious organisation in the UK. Specifically, the research aims to investigate the life histories of older adults in relation to their unbelief (including their backgrounds, childhood, religious background), the significance and expression of unbelief in older adults’ everyday lives and the implication of their unbelief in relation to specific life events (e.g. education, relationships, family, illness, death, loss).

In a pilot study involving over 200 American participants (mostly unbelievers of several varieties that we did not distinguish), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events (often involving purported ghosts or paranormal phenomena) that challenged that belief. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the frequency with which they experience challenging events, the types of challenging experiences that they reported, and finally how they have reconciled them with their existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we have established a framework for classifying both participants’ experiences, and their strategies for defending their worldviews.

		"text": "Reimagining the Imaginaries: Towards a Biocultural Theory of Nonreligion A number of scholars of nonreligion and secularity have argued in recent years for the need to get beyond the neat binaries and the negative identities signaled by atheism and agnosticism (e.g., Taves, Asprem & Ihm, 2018). Charles Taylor in his seminal work A Secular Age (2007) makes a famous case against the ‘subtraction stories’ expressed in the popular narrative as a mere reduction of religious belief. Taylor’s interpretation is deeply psychological and gives an account of the radical transformation of the social imaginaries that shape the way we conceptualize the world we inhabit. However, there is little attention given to the non-cognitive aspects of the social imaginaries in recent scholarship. Kathleen Lennon argues that imaginaries should be defined as the ‘bearers of affective significance, the means by which we not only think but feel our way around that world’ (Lennon, 2004: 111). Conceptualizing imaginaries as a way of collective production of sense offers a helpful way of engaging with the question of how differently historied bodies come to experience and engage with the world in different ways, and leads to the possibility of thinking about the role of imaginaries in constituting different minds and different bodies with different capacities. In this paper I will argue that the language of social imaginaries is helpful for building a bridge between the cognitive and affective elements of nonreligion. I will engage with the recent work of cognitive anthropologists Tanya Luhrmann and Even Danziger on metacognitive diversity and the ‘local theories of mind’ and the role they play in religious experience to argue that a more polyvalent way of approaching social imaginaries offers a helpful contribution to the biocultural theory of both religion and non-religion. The Anatomy of Unbelief: Cognitive Science of Religion and Secularization 'The road atlases of belief versus disbelief and religion versus secularism, provide maps that are much neater and tidier than the spaces in which we find ourselves,' writes James Smith (2014). In this paper I explore the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) approaches to nonreligion and unbelief and challenge their strong focus on 'the absence’ of belief in supernatural agency. I compare the way in which CSR scholars have approached unbelief in the past to the traditional secularization theories and the 'hermeneutical project’ criticised by Mahmood (2006) for its secularised conception of religion understood as 'an abstracted category of beliefs and doctrines.’ Together with Geertz (2010) and Smith (2014) who come against the 'religion for the disembodied minds’, I argue for the importance of developing a biocultural theory of religion, which is based on an expanded view of cognition anchored both in the brain and the body, and extended beyond the borders of individual brains. I develop a cognitive approach to non-religion and unbelief focused on 'the presence' rather than 'the absence’ of belief, drawing the parallels between the concept of 'implicit beliefs’, central to CSR and Talal Asad’s, Saba Machmood’s and Charles Taylor’s notions of 'implicit religion,' 'background sense,' 'deep/ background grammars,' 'commitments,' 'attachments,' and 'schesis’. I argue that such an approach would uniquely accommodate contemporary biological, social and cognitive sciences and provide a way forward for future CSR studies. ",

		"text": "Is Unbelief the New Frontier of Interreligious Dialogue? Religious Literacy in Comparative Context Within the past two decades, the concept of religious literacy has gained currency in both scholarly and popular discourse. A trans-Atlantic, Anglophone conversation has emerged as U.S. and U.K. policymakers have called for increased public understanding of religion through educational training programmes within various areas of civil society. In many instances, proponents of religious literacy appear to question unbelievers’ ability to engage with religion, often explicitly citing the idea that the need for religious literacy results from our so-called secular society’s lost ability to interact with religious populations and to identify religious tropes. Against this backdrop, my paper asks what religious literacy could mean within the context of increasing nonreligious populations and a growing awareness of cultures of unbelief. This paper examines the ways in which the U.S. and U.K.’s sociocultural and religious landscapes may inform and impact the representation of unbelief and nonreligion within policy proposals. Taking Christopher Cotter’s (2018) call to bridge the gap between critical religion and the growing area of scholarship on nonreligion, this paper examines the ways in which the constructed categories of religion and nonreligion are treated in comparative contexts of U.S. and U.K. religious literacy proposals. This paper suggests that defining what constitutes religion is not simply an ontological project in this instance. Rather, since religious literacy is by definition rooted in the practical and the practicable, examining what gets included and what gets left off the table has consequences for the presentation of religion and nonreligion in such training programmes. Arguing that the problem and implications of defining religion (and delineating nonreligion) have not been faced fully in policy proposals, this paper contends that religious literacy trainings provide a site from which to question the ethic of inclusion in the growing discussion around how people with and without religious beliefs will collaborate and enter into dialogue ",

		"text": "“Preach Sistah!!!” – Co-Effecting Third Spaces of Emotive Resonance This paper looks at a particular culture unbelief using Michael Warner’s (2005) concept of publics and counterpublics. I examine the videos and comment sections of 60 US women or gender queer persons in relation to their experiences of, on the one hand, publicly performing atheist identity in the US context, a culture that strongly ties the idea of good citizenship to religiosity. On the other hand, in relation to what it means to speak out as a woman or gender queer person in a minority discourse dominated by men. I thus explore the particular socio-technical affordances shaping these narratives and their reception in relation to femininity, atheism, and the US context, asking how theories of self-performance, counterpublics, and third spaces in digital religion help us understand what is happening in these types of spaces. In examining and extending Warner’s (2005) model of publics, this paper thus considers how vloggers co-effect third spaces of emotive resonance that enable a precarious counterpublicness of performing atheist visibility, and thus aims to highlight emotive and affective aspects of non-religious identity Coming Out as an Atheist: Embedded and Embodied Self Performance on YouTube In this paper I will present the findings of my PhD project. My project aims to expand previous research on atheism by looking specifically at women atheists, who have not been extensively researched. I look at US women performing atheists on YouTube, as well as the technological and relational networks surrounding these videos. Using Actor Network Theory (ANT) I will be looking at these women’s performances as relational and embedded in a particular nexus of technology, associative logic, templates of behavior, as well as material affordances and objects (Latour 2005). I will also be utilizing the idea of counter-public(s) (Downey & Fenton, 2003) in order to tease apart how intersectional concerns affect the particular concerns of different women. The purpose of my study is to look at lived non-religion, not in order to categorize or make sense of the non-religious but to look at the performance of the personal and stigmatized in an ambivalent public. ANT will also be instrumental in dismantling and examining my own preconceptions of the field before and during the collection of empirical work. I will particularly discuss the implications of imagining community or group identity before entering such a disparate field as expressions of non-religiosity on YouTube. I will also examine the use of categories in my work – such as non-religion, and atheism – in order to tease apart what the identification of these women as such hides or magnifies in their narratives. Grassroots Atheism and the Atheist Movement In this research we examine research done on the (at the time) unmoderated and hugely popular online atheist forum – reddit.com/r/atheism – in relation to the ideology new atheism and the atheist movement in North America. The study on /r/atheism was a qualitative study conducted in early 2013, which traced discursive practices on an online space with no official ties to atheist or humanist organizations. The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the 'practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory. Our cooperation has thus impelled us to ask questions regarding the use and construction of atheism in our respective work, as well as questions on which scientific research inform our different choices, and how this is reflected in the write up process.

These results break new ground in the identification of and psychological utility for distinct unbeliefs Modeling Pathways of Unbelief Across Cultural Contexts This presentation will address both of the major questions guiding the “Cultures of Unbelief” conference by outlining the conceptual architectures and initial experimental findings of two computational models of unbelief. Social simulation techniques of the sort to be described here enable researchers to test hypotheses about the ways in which micro-level psychological variables and individual behaviors (such as levels of unbelief and affiliation with in-groups that exclude believers) can lead to the emergence of macro-level sociological phenomena at the population level (such as demographic changes related to unbelief and group affiliation). By constructing simulated agents with psychologically realistic cognitive architectures (and individual variables such as class, age, gender and education) who interact within an “artificial society,” and validating those interactions in light of real-world data sets, researchers can run experiments that explore how different cultural contextual conditions (parameters) can alter the pathways through which individual agents alter their religious beliefs and behaviors. And this is exactly what our research teams have done. At last year’s conference in London, we offered an introduction to the relevant models, which were just underway. Our presentation at the NSRN conference was featured in the most recent issue of Der Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/glaube-was-haelt-religionen-zusammen-was-schwaecht-sie-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000161665903. In the currently proposed paper, we would like to present an update on two models that are directly relevant to the conference theme. The first is a systems-dynamics model of the “analytic” pathway to atheism, which includes parameters that allow us to test how contextual factors (such as presence of religion in the environment) impact this pathway. The second is an agent-based model of CRED theory. In the latter, agents have variables such as gender, education, employment, etc., as well as “worldviews” (religious or nonreligious). We will present the architectures and our initial findings, which help to shed light on “the nature of unbelief” and “the ways in which different types of unbelief” shift across cultural contexts. Analyzing Analytic Worldviews: Particularizing Nonreligion through Computational Modeling and Simulation The proposed paper will present a computational model of the conditions under which – and the mechanisms by which – more individuals within a population engage in critically reflective, naturalistic explanations of the world. The authors (see below) are part of a broader project that is developing a series of computer simulations designed to shed light on the causes and effects of atheism, as well as the dynamics within and pathways toward nonreligious worldviews. We operationalize the latter as involving attempts to make sense of the world and act sensibly within society without appealing to supernatural agents and authorities. The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts. We hope to show how our model can be utilized to test hypotheses that derive from a host of disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and religious studies. Non-Belief: An Islamic Perspective Psychology of religion research is typically conducted with Protestant populations living in the West. Only recently has non-belief in God become a central topic in the field. And while it remains an open question whether or not the research assumptions and theoretical frameworks designed for Western populations of Protestants can be applied to non-believers, exploring non-belief in the Islamic context may pose additional problems. For example, do Western concepts and terms such as “church attendance” or “atheist” have equivalent meaning in the Muslim world? Are there any structural differences within Islam and Christianity that may contribute to the uneven number of self-reported non-believers within these cultures? In this article, we argue that a cultural psychological approach can provide a useful perspective for researching non-belief in the Muslim cultural context. Implicit Frameworks: The Tyrannical Hegemonic Discourse         sets out a rhetorical argument promoting the notion of ‘implicit atheism’ as a means to critique the concept of implicit religion, highlighting problems that can arise when researchers employ ‘religious’ language in reference to nonreligious individuals.

In this paper, I shall argue that scholars of religion and nonreligion should accept the fact that “religion” and “nonreligion” are, like most (if not all) social scientific concepts, fuzzy categories. Scholars of religion and nonreligion should therefore abandon the clichéd definitional handwringing, and instead carry on with their research, treating terms and their definitions as convenient and evolving delimiters of their favoured areas of enquiry.

There has been global increase in individuals who lack religious beliefs; however, these individuals still hold distinct ontological, epistemological and ethical beliefs about reality. Little is known about the types of such ‘unbeliefs’ and their psychological functions, or about their variation globally. In this project, we ran a systematic review to examine the psychological functions of secular beliefs (e.g., coping), and we found similar results to those of religious beliefs, demonstrating the bolstering nature of worldviews more generally. Moreover, we ran an open-ended questionnaire with 100 participants in 10 countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, and Brazil) to survey types of beliefs and worldviews across the globe. In the analysis, we found that these responses roughly fit in eight super-categories: science and critical thinking, natural laws and the here and now, equality and care, collaboration and peace, having (no) control, morality and truth, reflection, (anti-)religion and mysticism. Secular versus religious worldviews: Do they fulfil the same psychological functions? A global increase in individuals who do not hold religious beliefs, and a concurrent increase in secular organisations and even secular rituals (e.g., humanist weddings and funerals), begs for a better understanding of what unbelief entails. Unbelief can be defined as a negative phenomenon, as lacking in religious beliefs, but we argue that non-believers still hold distinct ontological, epistemological and ethical beliefs about reality. We hypothesise that like religious beliefs, such secular beliefs will have profound effects at cognitive, motivational, and emotional levels. Specifically, this project investigates in two studies whether such secular beliefs –organised in worldviews like religious beliefs– have similar psychological functions to religious beliefs, such as providing sources of meaning or coping mechanisms. Study 1 comprises of a systematic review of the current literature on psychological functions of secular beliefs and worldviews. In study 2, the range of psychological functions of secular beliefs will be further investigated through cross-cultural surveys in the UK, Denmark, and Turkey. Study 2 will be an ongoing project until the summer of 2019, but preliminary results will be presented. Together, these studies will inform us how worldviews –whether secular or religious– support us psychologically. Using Neuromodulation to Change Belief – and Unbelief       introduces cognitive research exploring how religious beliefs can be modulated. She shows how reframing such research as stimulating of 'unbelief’ open new avenues for new ways of exploring the nature of unbelief and its similarities and dissimilarities to religious and spiritual beliefs.

		"text": "What do unbelievers believe?: A psychological test of form and function Compared to the one thing unbelievers reject (i.e. God), very little is known about what unbelievers actually believe in. Moreover,  ’s (2013) 'replacement hypothesis' suggests that, whatever these beliefs might be, they may replace the psychological functions commonly associated with religious beliefs. Across three studies, our presentation addresses these issues utilizing a mixed-methodological approach. In study one we ask unbelieving individuals directly, 'if you don't believe in God, then what do you believe in?' Through thematic coding, 4 domains of surrogate beliefs were identified (science, humanistic beliefs, believing in one’s self, and moral realism). In study two, we test how these surrogate beliefs may provide meaning in life and protective benefits against death anxiety and perceived stress. In study three, we partially replicate the previous results and test the possibility that surrogate beliefs provide benefits exclusively to unbelievers by comparing a sample of theists and atheists. These results break new ground in the identification of and psychological utility for distinct unbeliefs Understanding Unbelief Across Disciplines, Across Cultures We'll present headline findings from the Understanding Unbelief’s core research: Understanding Unbelief: Across Disciplines Across Cultures (ADAC) conducted in Brazil, China, Denmark, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The findings challenges some of the supposed differences between theists and atheists, showing how each group has beliefs you would not necessarily expect them to and highlights the messiness of atheism and agnosticism as it is lived in everyday life. For instance, the report shows how: Unbelief in God doesn’t necessarily entail unbelief in other supernatural phenomena. Atheists and (less so) agnostics exhibit lower levels of supernatural belief than do the wider populations. However, only minorities of atheists or agnostics in each of our countries appear to be thoroughgoing naturalists ( ,  ,   and  , 2019: 3). The interim findings also shows how on the whole, there are as many similarities as differences between unbelievers and the general population when it come to what is important and what gives meaning in the world, with ‘family’ and ‘freedom’ being the top ranked by both atheists and agnostics, as well as the general population. Is atheism a religion? Psychological & Anthropological Perspectives This panel will consider atheism and religion from the perspectives of psychology and anthropology and will seek to bring scientific theory and evidence to bear on these questions and establish how it might (and might not) make sense to liken atheism to a religion. Belief in science and in the “Da Vinci Code”: Measuring naturalistic beliefs and its cognitive correlates This paper describes the development of a scale of naturalistic beliefs by the author of the paper, in collaboration with philosophers Guy Kahane and Nick Shackle, and the historian of science John Hedley Brooke. Preliminary validation of the scale was carried out with a sample of religious and atheist students (N = 130), that also filled in a number of other measures, including belief in ideas put forward in the best-selling ―Da Vinci Code‖ novel, knowledge of the Bible, and standardised cognitive and personality scales. I will present and discuss the newly developed scale on naturalistic beliefs as a way of tapping into contemporary atheists' ideas and attitudes, particularly related to the value attributed to science in understanding the world. I will also discuss some apparently contradictory evidence suggesting that atheists have higher scores both on ―need for cognition‖ and ―Da Vinci Code beliefs‖ than religious people. ",

		"text": "Examining the Multidimensional Nature of Unbelief: A Psychological Approach In this talk, I will describe the theoretical basis and results of a program of research that utilizes a psychological understanding of secularism and nonreligion to identify the nature and types of unbelief present in varying cultural contexts. This approach conceptualizes “unbelief” as a collection of interrelated beliefs, attitudes, and value dimensions that are part of a secular meaning system or worldview. Theoretically, this approach is derived from work that has examined the psychology of worldviews and values, cross-cultural psychology, as well as the existential motivations underlying human belief systems. Methodologically, it relies upon the quantitative, self-report methodologies prominently used in psychological assessment and the psychology of religion. By adopting this kind of approach, researchers can conceptualize secularism and nonreligion as a positive belief system that can be both distinct from and overlapping with religious worldviews. In a set of studies, my research team and I used this framework to explore the multidimensional nature of secularism and nonreligion present in samples of Canadian students and a cross-cultural sample of adult respondents from 24 different nations. Survey items were generated via group discussion of the nature of secular worldviews and review of previously published nonreligion typologies. Analysis of the survey responses identified several common core belief dimensions connected to unbelief (e.g., anti-religion/scientism, secular indifference, humanistic values) that were similar across cultural contexts. There were also several key divergences (e.g., cross-national differences and differences across rural versus urban cultural contexts). Importantly, by adopting this belief system framework, we were also able to identify key underlying cultural attitudes, beliefs, and moral orientations connected to particular dimensions of secularism and nonbelief. For example, the presence of individualistic values and moralities based in fairness/justice concerns were correlated with anti-religious beliefs, while experiences with secular upbringing predicted religious indifference. The implications of these findings and the broader significance of a psychological understanding of unbelief for the burgeoning field of secularism studies will be discussed ",

		"text": "Modeling Pathways of Unbelief Across Cultural Contexts This presentation will address both of the major questions guiding the “Cultures of Unbelief” conference by outlining the conceptual architectures and initial experimental findings of two computational models of unbelief. Social simulation techniques of the sort to be described here enable researchers to test hypotheses about the ways in which micro-level psychological variables and individual behaviors (such as levels of unbelief and affiliation with in-groups that exclude believers) can lead to the emergence of macro-level sociological phenomena at the population level (such as demographic changes related to unbelief and group affiliation). By constructing simulated agents with psychologically realistic cognitive architectures (and individual variables such as class, age, gender and education) who interact within an “artificial society,” and validating those interactions in light of real-world data sets, researchers can run experiments that explore how different cultural contextual conditions (parameters) can alter the pathways through which individual agents alter their religious beliefs and behaviors. And this is exactly what our research teams have done. At last year’s conference in London, we offered an introduction to the relevant models, which were just underway. Our presentation at the NSRN conference was featured in the most recent issue of Der Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/glaube-was-haelt-religionen-zusammen-was-schwaecht-sie-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000161665903. In the currently proposed paper, we would like to present an update on two models that are directly relevant to the conference theme. The first is a systems-dynamics model of the “analytic” pathway to atheism, which includes parameters that allow us to test how contextual factors (such as presence of religion in the environment) impact this pathway. The second is an agent-based model of CRED theory. In the latter, agents have variables such as gender, education, employment, etc., as well as “worldviews” (religious or nonreligious). We will present the architectures and our initial findings, which help to shed light on “the nature of unbelief” and “the ways in which different types of unbelief” shift across cultural contexts. Uncovering the hidden nature of unbelief We focus on religious unbelief among participants from Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands (N=4404). In Study 1, three unbeliever groups were identified: Analytic atheists (with no supernatural beliefs and strong analytic thinking), spiritual but not religious individuals (relying on intuitions and endorsing cognitive biases and supernatural beliefs), and uncertain nonbelievers (falling between the two groups). Studies 2–5 are in progress. In Study 2, participants chose often atheist, nonreligious, agnostic or irreligious as their identification. Less than 10% identified as secular, religious, spiritual but not religious, or spiritual seeker. These eight groups had different attitudes toward religion in terms of evaluation and attitude importance, ambivalence and interest. Study 3 shows that having a simple view of knowledge and trusting personal justification in religion predicts seeing science and religion as conflicting whereas endorsing cognitive biases and viewing religion to be important for society predicts the non-conflict view. Studies 4 and 5 are EEG studies. Study 4 investigates implicit attitudes towards religious and spiritual topics in different groups of unbelievers. Study 5 investigates to what extent different unbelievers endorse implicit supernatural beliefs, by having participants evaluate different supernatural belief concepts in either a belief or a disbelief context. Analyzing Analytic Worldviews: Particularizing Nonreligion through Computational Modeling and Simulation The proposed paper will present a computational model of the conditions under which – and the mechanisms by which – more individuals within a population engage in critically reflective, naturalistic explanations of the world. The authors (see below) are part of a broader project that is developing a series of computer simulations designed to shed light on the causes and effects of atheism, as well as the dynamics within and pathways toward nonreligious worldviews. We operationalize the latter as involving attempts to make sense of the world and act sensibly within society without appealing to supernatural agents and authorities. The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts. We hope to show how our model can be utilized to test hypotheses that derive from a host of disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and religious studies.

Unbelief in 'Glocal’ Perspective This paper presents initial findings from Understanding Unbelief, Across Disciplines, Across Cultures (ADAC), the central research project of the Understanding Unbelief research programme. ADAC offers a mixed method and cross-cultural perspective on the outlooks and worldviews of atheists and other religious 'unbelievers’, providing a comparative analysis of Brazil, Denmark, Japan, the UK and the US. One aspect of this methodology is indepth interviews with an array of 'unbelievers’ in each of these settings (n 30), and each national sample is split across three distinctive local settings (n10 in each locale). This paper focuses on the UK interviews, examining the ways in which local 'microclimates’ impact upon the outlooks and narratives emerging in these discussions. It also discusses this British experience of intra-national regionality in relation to types and patterns of local variation in Brazil, Denmark, Japan and the US, exploring whether and how regional effects need themselves to be understood in national and global context. What’s in a name? … In this blog post     and     address the need for a common set of accessible and rigorous terms for the study and wider discussion of atheism, nonreligion, secularity et al.. They explain how their new project, The Oxford Dictionary of Atheism, will address this need and introduce a glossary of key terms excerpted from the Dictionary that are already available for use. Jewish Atheists, Protestant Humanists and Nonreligious Agnostics: Existential Culture, 'Hybridity’ and Nonreligious Diversity The existential dimension of human life has been a minor theme in contemporary social science, in line with the dominant view in social theory (e.g. modernization theory, secularization theory) that the decline of religion, detraditionalisation and other processes of social transformation serve to diminish existential experience in modern and late modern societies. In contrast to such theories, this paper presents evidence that existential life is reformed rather than reduced in contemporary societies. It draws on qualitative research exploring nonreligious identification in southeast England to demonstrate the ways in which informants engage with the existential and metaphysical, not only through thought and belief, but also through rituals, symbolic forms and social interactions. It shows how the variety and cultural contingency of these existential cultures can provide new ways to understand the diversity of nonreligious beliefs and cultures. It also points to commonalities and opportunities for cultural exchange between religious, spiritual and nonreligious existential cultures, and the ways in which individuals may draw on and sometimes combine these different traditions. I argue that a cultural turn in understandings of atheism, nonreligion and secularity help us to understand these complex or 'hybrid’ existential cultural formations. Secular or Nonreligious? Profiling and Theorising European and US 'Religious Landscapes’ In profiling religiosity, Europe and the US are almost always described as different: 'secular Europe’ and 'religious America’. This paper presents quantitative data that show that the secular population (i.e. the number of people who are more or less indifferent to religion) is consistent not only across European countries but is also of a similar scale in Europe and the US. On the other hand, the size of the active nonreligious population varies, between these countries and continents. Thus, secularity appears to be less significant for understanding differences between the European and US 'religious landscapes’ than active participation in religious and nonreligious cultures: several European countries appear to have vital nonreligious cultures with established histories, whilst this is an emerging phenomenon in the US. I argue therefore that the study of nonreligion as distinct from secularity is fundamental to progressing understanding of contemporary societies and theorising their causes and development. Are Religion and Nonreligion All in the Mind? NSRN director     explains why researchers of nonreligion must look beyond purely intellectual and cognitive expressions of nonreligious rationalism. That Bunch of Atheists? A Short Introduction to the NSRN In our introductory post NSRN director and founder,    , discusses the work of the NSRN, the vision behind the new NS blog, and recounts her experience of the common mis-conflation of nonreligion and secularity research with atheism and atheist advocacy NSRN Glossary Given that the core terminology for nonreligion often involves terms with allocated rather than intrinsic meaning (c.f. for example 'unreligion’, 'nonreligion’, 'areligion’), this glossary gives a guide to how such terms are used throughout this website. N.B. This terminology does not include definitions of religion, theism or other relative concepts. The argument is that being precise about different forms of contingency is useful in itself – and are meaningfully distinct regardless of how their NSRN Glossary contingent terms are understood. E.g. the concept of 'nonreligion’ is contingent on notions of 'religion’, which might be viewed as an analytic category or as a human construction or as both. This website is interested in the breadth of nonreligion research and therefore in both uses of the term and according to all definitions of religion; it therefore does not stipulate which of these two approaches, the realist or constructivist, it is taking. . My doctoral research (2006-) has sought to investigate the substance and variety of nonreligious perspectives and practices. I have used two main methods: (i) situated ethnography, in North London and with some auto-ethnographic aspects, and (ii) interviews and participant observation with participants selected via a maximum variation sampling strategy – that is, I have looked for cases of potential nonreligiosity that are as different as possible from one another, in order to try to consider the parameters of any field we might want to call „nonreligion‟. Attention has been focused on the possible range of nonreligious outlooks, symbolic representations and political expressions. My theoretical framework has been shaped by an interest in modernisation and individualisation theories and, as a result, I have also been interested in the personal-social aspects of lived nonreligion – for which I have used, amongst other things, a qualitative social network exercise for the interviewing process.

Is atheism a religion? Psychological & Anthropological Perspectives This panel will consider atheism and religion from the perspectives of psychology and anthropology and will seek to bring scientific theory and evidence to bear on these questions and establish how it might (and might not) make sense to liken atheism to a religion. On the Necessity of Fractionating “Atheism” Can “atheism,” be an object of scientific analysis? Academics and other social actors approach “atheism” with a range of interests, producing substantial diversity in how the term is defined, analysed, and utilised. Given the importance of such interests in conceptual construction, one may ask whether “atheism” exists as an independent phenomenon amenable to scientific analysis, or, rather, following the supposed fate of “religion” (Smith, 1998; Fitzgerald, 2000) and the “secular” (Asad, 2003), as a mere social construction. This question is not without consequence. If “atheism” only exists as a socially constructed concept and not as an independent object, then analysis of its supposed causes and effects becomes, like astrology, folly. I will argue that “atheism” is indeed a social construct. This would seem to doom any scientific study of atheism and leave us only to document how the term is experienced and utilized by various social actors. However, I will argue that a science of atheism is still possible. To do so, I will utilize the metatheoretical principle of “fractionation” developed by cognitive anthropologists (Boyer, 1994; Whitehouse &  , 2014) in their scientific studies of “religion.” Fractionating a constructed object of analysis involves breaking it up into distinct phenomena about whose independence we are more confident and which may have divergent causes and effects. Based on my field and survey research with atheists in the US, UK, and Denmark, as well as insights from the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, I will propose three (non-exhaustive) fractionated elements of “atheism:” 1) absence of (implicit/explicit) belief in the existence of God/gods, 2) moral judgement of the immorality of “religion,” and 3) social identities that prominently feature “atheism” or other forms of “nonreligion.” I will argue that each exists in the world beyond our scholarly conceptions and with distinct sets of causes and effects. A cognitive perspective helps make the scientific study of atheism possible     reflects on how cognitive and evolutionary studies of religion have contributed to research on atheism – and suggests how such approaches might advance our understanding of atheism in the future. Religious Actions Speak Louder than Words: Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs) Predicts Theism and Non-theism A central claim of the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that pan-human cognitive mechanisms explain supernatural agent beliefs. This claim faces the challenge of accounting for nontheism. More precisely, if nearly all human beings possess the cognitive mechanisms outlined by CSR scholars, then how do we explain patterns in the presence of theists and non-theists? Evolutionary anthropologist Joseph Henrich has proposed the existence of a psychological bias focused on “Credibility Enhancing Displays” (CREDs). We are biased, Henrich argues, to believe the representations we receive from others to the extent that they 'walk the walk’ and not just 'talk the talk’. The implication for theism and non-theism is that individuals will be much less likely to acquire the theistic beliefs of their communities if they are not exposed to sufficient levels of CREDs. We will present new evidence from a diverse sample of Americans suggesting that CREDs exposure, as measured by our recently validated scale (alpha= .92), predicts theism vs. non-theism (B= .519, p< .01), all while controlling for religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for theism. They suggest that actions do indeed speak louder than words in convincing individuals of the reality of supernatural agents and that, to be successfully transmitted, religious commitments must be embodied. Atheism explained: The evolutionary origin of atheistic thought   argues that atheism – like religion in Boyer‟s account – is not an evolutionary byproduct. Instead, its distribution can be explained by „human-nature‟ (aspects of our evolved psychological make-up) in interaction with the socio-cultural contexts in which we live.   guides us through this hypothesis. There is, he said, a large body of evidence against the idea that humans come to our understandings solely through a process of rational reflection. Instead, we see patterns in random occurrences; we often fall prey to our own confirmation bias, tending to look for evidence to confirm our views and rarely looking for evidence to disprove it. Rather, „rationality‟ is usually used to describe a normative vision of how we should think a view prevalent in contemporary Atheist and Humanist discourse. Yet rationalism fails as a general explanation for nonreligious normative stances, instead we need to look to socio-cultural.  ‟s ultimate view is that neither belief or non-belief are natural; we need to start from a view that our behaviour is mostly unconscious and our brains are wired to numerous specialisms which can be affected without damaging the overall intelligence or other specialist functions. A secular mind Cognitive anthropologists argue that we can better answer enduring anthropological questions by utilizing the growing insights of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This belief is not wholly unjustified, as cognitive anthropologists have had some success in addressing the long-standing question of why religious beliefs and practices are so widespread in human populations, mostly in reference to universal cognitive biases. This success, however, raises another enduring anthropological question, that of how to best account for ―secularization.‖ If religious beliefs are so well supported by universal cognitive biases, whence secularization and atheism? In this presentation, I will argue that a cognitive approach can help answer one important element of the secularization debate, the question of whether or not particular socio-economic environments cause decreased levels of religious belief and commitment. I will present both qualitative and quantitative data from my fieldwork and survey research among non-theists in Western countries suggesting that particular socio-economic environments do indeed lower levels of religious belief and that this effect occurs through the impact of these environments on our cognitive mechanisms devoted to reasoning about social groups and about what representations to accept from others.

Why the Sudden Interest? After a long history of neglect, what explains the sudden and sizeable growth of interest in nonreligion and secularity? NSRN director     offers his insights.  Defining 'Atheism’: A Modest Proposal Lois Lee’s draft glossary provides us which much – and valuable – food for thought. However with one definition, at least, I find myself in disagreement: Atheism – a conscious or unconsious lack of commitment to God(s) (2011: 2) Commitment strikes me as a problematic and ambiguous category. Is this a lack of intellectual commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of commitment to (the idea that there exists [a]) God(s)’ ? Or a lack of what one might term an existential commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of (personal, devoted, trusting?) commitment to God(s)’? The former might imply the latter, but the same is not true vice versa. It can be argued that while a great many Britons have at least some kind of intellectual commitment to the idea of God existing (even if this commitment extends only to ticking the requisite box on sociologists’ surveys), comparatively few have the kind of existential commitment to God(s), traditionally expressed through regular prayer, attendance at religious services, etc. This ambiguity could, of course, be clarified fairly satisfactorily. However, I believe a far better and usable definition of 'atheism’ – one already in scholarly use – can be located in the category not of 'commitment’, but of 'belief’. What I want to do in this short paper, then, is simply to outline what I believe to be a fairly uncontroversial definition of atheism already in scholarly use: 'a lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods’. While I will be presenting a case for the utility of this definition, I do not intend to do so in any exhaustive, defeat-all-comers way. All I am wanting to do is to put one (I think good) definition on the table, as a stimulus to discussion and debate. . My own research has, so far, focused on two main areas - the resonances or overtones which certain terms, such as 'atheist', might have for people (especially survey participants), and the phenomenon of 'irreligious experiences' (roughly speaking, the converse of classic, Jamesian 'religious' experiences). My primary interest at present, however, is on the role of the internet - especially social media and networks - in generating and sustaining the (in many ways surprising) rise of the New Atheism, especially in the USA. I'm particularly interested in exploring this theoretically in light of Berger and Luckmann's theory of 'plausibility structures'. ",

		"text": "Reclaiming Enchantment I will argue for a “reclaiming of enchantment” as a means of reconceptualizing human/nonhuman animal relations and more adequately addressing environmental degradation and climate change. I'll put forth three key steps that need to be taken in order to reclaim enchantment: 1. Reject the myth of disenchantment that has dominated much of the theorizing about modernization and secularization, 2. Expand the definition of enchantment to include “immanent enchantment” and “nonreligious frequencies” that have nothing to do with magic and gods, and 3. Recognize that nonreligious frequencies of meaning are vital to saving the planet. I'll argue for rejecting the “stewardship” model of human/environment interactions that many religions promote, and instead suggest a “queering of stewardship” that would eliminate the hierarchical-ownership model that stewardship often entails. Reframing Assisted Dying: Nonreligion and the Law Law and religion frequently interact, sometimes as a matter of challenging religion’s reach into public spaces, sometimes as a matter of reentrenching majority religion. But what about nonreligion and the law? In this piece,   G.   argues that subtle shifts in legal approaches can be revealing of the often mysterious contents of nonreligion. Specifically, she asks: what could a nonreligious approach to assisted dying law look like? In the Name of a Draconian Conception of State Neutrality’: Law’s Affirmation that You Can’t be Good without God The legal regulation of religion extends beyond categories of religion to the emerging category of nones. Most famously, the Lautsi decision in Italy highlighted the tensions that emerge between historically dominant religious hegemonies and those whose lives are not informed by religious worldviews. And yet, the European Court of Human Rights entertained the notion that dominant religion is not necessarily religion per se, but represents universal and cultural values which inform and indeed benefit all of society. Contrary to the argument of atheists that one can be good without god, legal discourse is shaping a new rhetoric of the foundational nature of religion to the common good, an idea that presses even those who do not 'believe’ to believe, or to at least accept the inherent value of god in the creation of a good society. The universal truth of religion becomes, then, inescapable and impossible to opt out of. This new legal rhetoric has increasing traction in a number of western democracies whose majoritarian religion would seem to be in decline. Law is coming to the rescue, carving out a new place for religion as fundamental to societal well-being and religious practices and symbols in state institutions are therefore an acceptable and even welcome presence. This talk will explore these issues in light of the Saguenay case that is now before the Supreme Court of Canada. ",

		"text": "Atheism as a vocation: What can socialists teach us about modern belief and unbelief? Though at the time perceived as a period of religious decline and even crisis, the 1960s turned out to be a pivotal period for religious transformation that profoundly shifted the subsequent landscape of both belief and unbelief. One of the defining features of this period was the new willingness of different parties, both believers and unbelievers, to engage in dialogue across confessional and ideological lines. Perhaps the most unexpected and radical dialogue to emerge in this historical moment was between religion and socialism, the antagonism between which had been a structuring principle for religious and political life for more than a century, especially in Europe. We can find these new types of encounters between belief and unbelief in developments like the Christian-Marxist dialogues that emerged in both the West and the Communist world; the establishment and work of the Vatican’s Secretariat on Non-Believers, including its 1969 symposium on “The Culture of Unbelief,” which brought together church leaders, theologians, Marxist philosophers and Western sociologists to discuss the contours of modern belief and unbelief; and – most closely connected with my own work on Soviet atheism, recently published in A Sacred Space Is Never Empty: A History of Soviet Atheism (Princeton University Press, 2018) – the transformation in Soviet understandings and approaches to religion and atheism, evident in the emergence of a new forms of “scientific” and even “spiritual” atheism, new sociological studies of religion, and the identification of religious and ideological “indifference” as the defining feature of the modern religious and ideological landscape. This paper examines how these encounters and dialogues transformed both sides, and the legacies they bequeathed to contemporary religious and secular life. ",

		"text": "Religious unbelief in oral history archives This paper argues that the study of the nature and diversity of religious unbelief would benefit from attention to collections of oral history interviews – of which there are many in archives across the world – recorded in past projects in which religious unbelief (or belief) was far from being a focus for the interviewees or interviewers.  It does so by examining briefly (with audio clips as examples) ways in which the nature and diversity of religious unbelief is voiced in two such collections of ‘life story’ interviews at the British Library: one with workers in the UK water supply industry and a second with workers in the ‘City of London’ financial district. Asking grown-ups about religious unbelief In this post,     reflects on the how there are differences in the way children and adults are asked about religion and (un)belief in oral history interviews.

		"text": "Cultures and politics of nonbelieving in Egypt In Egypt, unbelief has recently become a major concern for religious and political authorities and blasphemy charges are regularly used against expressions of nonbelievers. Accordingly, coming out for nonbelieving is very difficult and sometimes dangerous. However, especially since the 2011-revolution, young people do contest the religious hegemony in the public sphere and speak out about their nonbelieving, particularly in the relatively safe space of social media (or confidential interviews). Leaving Islam is not only a cognitive process but also involves bodily acts, such as removing the veil and changing dietary habits, or transforms social and intimate relationships. Yet several nonbelievers also continue to embody parts of religion in order to ‘pass’ as a Muslim. They accordingly develop ambiguous ways of living unbelief. Based on online testimonials and interviews, this presentation will go into three themes. (1)The nature of unbelief: What are the different understandings about the nature of unbelief among believers and nonbelievers in Egypt? (2) The variety of unbelief: What are the various positions and self-identifications among nonbelievers in Egypt and how do they change over time? (3)Living unbelief: Which alternative outlooks on life and morality do nonbelievers develop and to what extent can they embody their new ideas?​ Understanding Nonbelief in Egypt Nonbelief is a highly sensitive and controversial topic at this particular moment in Egypt. The conceptual binary of religion and non-religion – regardless of the nature and variety of the nonbelievers’ worldview - militant atheism, discrete unbelief and skepticism, humanism, and even secularism - is politicized and mobilized in (social) media outlets. Yet particularly after the 2011 revolution, many - particularly young people - are searching within and beyond the religious tradition in which they were raised for sources of inspiration to fashion their worldview, including more orthodox forms of religion, Sufism, New Age, and varieties of unbelief. Particularly the latter is a great source of 'moral panic’. On the one hand, the assumed growing number of atheists is blamed on, and used to combat, 'extremist’ forms of religion. On the other hand, due to the hardened opposition between religion and non-religion, most nonbelievers who dare to speak out embrace a rather militant anti-religion discourse, leading to fierce debates and clashes in the (social) media. This paper, however, will try to uncover the different forms and experiences of doubt and unbelief. In addition to You Tube channels and other (social) media outlets, the paper is based on ongoing fieldwork and interviews in Egypt. I will use an intersectional approach by comparing the understanding and experiences of men and women, Muslims and Copts with religious doubts and non-belief. Taking a dynamic approach and without assuming (non)religion is a priori a 'thick identity’, I will detail the various trajectories of Egyptian skeptics and non-believers. ",

		"text": "Facing death without religion: the changing nature of unbelief over the life course Religion has long been a powerful source of meaning as human beings face their own mortality. Yet little is known about how non-religious individuals (atheists, agnostics, humanists, and others) make sense of death.  This paper reports on a 2 year qualitative study on non-religious meaning making in the later stages of life.  Meaning making is conceptualized as the construction of a map that imposes order onto unknown territory. Data are drawn from 95 narrative interviews with elderly individuals in the United States to show distinct patterns of secular map making. It is argued that secular maps, although built from different components, function similarly to religious ones. Organized Secularism in the United States: New Directions in Research There has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of the US population that is not religious. However, there is, to date, very little research on the social movement that is organizing to serve the needs of and advocate for the nonreligious in the US. This is a book about the rise and structure of organized secularism in the United States. By organized secularism we mean the efforts of nonreligious individuals to build institutions, networks, and ultimately a movement that serves their interests in a predominantly religious society. Researchers from various fields address questions such as: What secularist organizations exist? Who are the members of these organizations? What kinds of organizations do they create? What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past? And what is their likely impact on the future of secularism? For anyone trying to understand the rise of the nonreligious in the US, this book will provide valuable insights into organized efforts to normalize their worldview and advocate for their equal treatment in society.

		"text": "(Mis)understanding Unbelief in Estonia Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe, providing a possibility to study unbelief in a secular(ized) context, where religion has had very little visibility for more than 70 years. Also, there is a certain connection between unbelief and Estonian national identity. The paper draws on the interview-based research among the Estonian unbelievers, conducted in 2018-19 and focuses on three main topics. First of all, I’m trying to understand what counts as “unbelief” in this context, on what assumptions it is based and what does it entail. Second, I’m focusing on the “generations of unbelief”, trying to find out generational patterns and the impact of the Soviet experience on unbelief. Third, I’m interested whether and how the nationalist discourse on public level influences the unbelief on more personal level. In addition to these general themes, the paper sheds a light on some the most interesting or peculiar findings from my research material. Religious vs cultural? Some findings about the unexpected dichotomy When discussing their visits to the churches, a number of my nonreligious informants from Estonia have mentioned that their interest is not 'religious’, but 'cultural’. I have also noticed a similar tendency at conferences – while not directly opposing the two, some colleagues talk of religion and culture as separate entities. Both examples tell us quite a lot about how 'culture’ is perceived – in this context it’s actual meaning seems to be 'secular’ – or, at least, it has strong connotation with 'not religious’. Based on my findings from Estonian media and interviews with nonreligious informants, the paper explores the possibility of studying the essence of nonreligion via the mutual relationships of 'religion’, 'culture’ and 'nonreligion’. Particular attention is paid to the changes in the meanings of 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ words and their connotations. Crossbreeding Atheism with Spirituality: Notes on Soviet and Western Attempts The recent “nonreligious turn” in studies of secularity has changed the focus from what secularity lacks in comparison to religion to what it offers as an alternative. Various forms of nonreligion have been studied extensively in recent years, yet mostly in the contemporary Western societies. This article shifts the context more to the east and also towards the history by comparing two instances when meaning-making gained a central position within an atheist tradition. For our first example, we examine the appeal to spirituality in the period of late Soviet atheism; the second comes from contemporary Western “atheist spirituality”. By studying the publications by relevant authors, the article explores what can be learned about atheism and spirituality from this comparison, how atheism and spirituality are understood and combined, and the reasons for the sudden emphasis on existential questions within an atheist tradition. Has God Really Returned to Eastern Europe? A recent Washington Times editorial proclaimed “God Returns to Eastern Europe”. In this media response blog,     addresses the problems with survey questions, the conflation of terminology and how we measure religion to analyse if God really has returned to Eastern Europe. Researching the nonreligious in a secular society Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. The visibility of religion in society is low and nonreligiosity is considered normative. Estonians are also one of the nations (along with Czechs) in Europe who’s national identity is associated with atheism, in both cases expressed as “the most atheistic country in the world”. Nevertheless, different beliefs and practices associated with New Spirituality and indigenous Earth belief are very common. Thus, secularity in this context refers mostly to distance from conventional, theistic religion. The paper draws on the data from recent quantitative survey “On Life, Religion, and Religious Life” (2015). Among other questions, the survey offered participants two different possibilities for (non)religious identification, employing also the concept of Multiple Religious Belonging. Beside the information on religiosity, the results of the analysis also give interesting information about nonreligious identities in a secular context. Still, general results of the survey awoke serious doubts about the suitability of quantitative survey on conventional religion in a largely nonreligious society. In order to investigate the relevance of the quantitative survey, I conducted a qualitative study among the nonreligious using mainly the same questions and offering a possibility to explain one’s answers. The results largely confirmed my doubts. The paper addresses the issues that became clear during the qualitative study.  ",

While research on religious transmission has demonstrated the importance of family context, our multi-sited approach reveals the important role also played by both school context and children’s own reflections in shaping their formation as non-religious, suggesting a complex pattern of how non-religious socialization is occurring in Britain today. Coupled with this we also explore the varieties of children’s unbelief and how they are constructed in childhood. Data gathered from this study demonstrates the complexities and configurations of children’s unbelief, revealing the different types of beliefs (e.g. Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy) children hold as well as those they do not and what this can tell us about the nature and diversity of unbelief across the lifespan.  Growing Up Nonreligious: The Intra–Regionality of Children’s Unbeliefs This paper presents preliminary findings from an ethnographic project exploring how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be unbelieving, and how they experience and negotiate their unbeliefs across everyday school and family life. As numbers of the avowedly nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, particularly among younger age cohorts, this research advances our understanding of nonreligion and unbelief through addressing what it means to be unbelieving for children. Drawing on comparative fieldwork across three contrasting geographical 'microclimates’ of religion and nonreligion in the UK (Voas and McAndrew 2012), our project explores the everyday lived realities of children’s unbelief, and how this is experienced, performed and negotiated in relation to the times and spaces of school and home, and across different geographical settings. Our paper will focus particular attention on regional contingencies shaping children’s forms of unbelief, their values, and worldviews across the project’s three field sites located in urban, suburban and rural areas of the south west, north and north-west of England. Reflecting on the relative locations and clustering of religious or nonreligious groups in these contrasting parts of UK while also being attentive to the significance of gender, social class, and ethnicity in these locations, this paper will consider how such intra-regional differences contribute to children’s formation as unbelieving.

In this study, 786 Americans and 900 Canadian students completed a survey that assessed the extent of their eco-spiritual beliefs. (e.g., belief in 'gaia’ and their tendencies to anthropomorphize the natural world), a diverse set of attitudinal measures regarding climate change related issues, and a set of novel measures assessing sacred value orientations to protecting the environment. We find that although individuals who do not believe in god(s) do score lower on supernatural eco-spiritual beliefs than believers individuals, they do not reject these beliefs to the same extent as they do belief in god(s). And importantly, these types of beliefs have similar downstream consequences in both groups in predicting attitudinal concern for, moralization of, pro-environmental behaviours (including actual green charity donations) and sacred value orientations towards the issue of protecting the natural world. This work provides an important case study in understanding how the psychology and behaviours of self-professed nonbelievers can still be influenced by supernatural beliefs.  ",

		"text": "Irish Ex-Catholicism and the Morality of Unbelief While unbelievers are frequently stereotyped as immoral, moral concerns play a defining role in many unbelieving worldviews. Drawing on a nationally representative survey of baptised Catholics and a year-long period of fieldwork, this presentation describes contemporary Irish ex-Catholicism as a particularly heightened example of moralised unbelief. Survey data suggests that for ex-Catholics, the Catholic Church is primarily associated with basic immorality and unpalatable conservativism. Ethnographic fieldwork and interviews suggest that this moral stance is best understood as a reaction to the intertwining forces of religious scandal, the Church’s influence on social institutions, and ‘cultural Catholicism’, a ‘passive’ and ‘complicit’ force perceived to perpetuate the status quo. The moral quest for full liberation from Catholic influence is the central driving component of ex-Catholicism. This ambition is complicated by the existence of a cultural Catholic ‘ethic of harmony’ which prioritises local traditions while privatising personal unbelief. Against this backdrop, cultural Catholics are sometimes viewed as secret unbelievers who ought to be ‘woken’ into disaffiliation so that the project of secularization can be more swiftly achieved. Failing God? The effects of Church scandals on Catholic belief and affiliation in Ireland I will present on my research into the effects of perceived 'religious hypocrisy’ on religious belief and affiliation, focusing on the context of contemporary Irish Catholicism. Despite collapses in trust and practice since the promulgation of the clerical sexual abuse scandals from the early 1990s onwards and a swiftly growing minority identifying as non-religious, survey data still return unusually high levels of religious belief and affiliation in Ireland by European standards, something that has led sociologists to propose that by and large the Irish population remain 'believers’ and 'cultural Catholics’ despite their growing lack of institutional engagement (Davie, 1994; Donnelly & Inglis, 2009). My research examines the accuracy of this characterisation utilising a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Dublin with experimental techniques built on a theoretical standpoint taken from the cognitive science of religion. These experiments aim to directly test whether religious credence is undermined when cultural learners witness 'Credibility Undermining Displays’, namely instances where religious paragons fail to 'practice what they preach’ (Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012). My presentation will cover the preliminary data yielded by these experiments, and compliment this with the more nuanced qualitative findings drawn from my fieldwork and interviews among informants from two Dublin parishes. Together, it is hoped that these preliminary findings will suggest insights regarding how exactly the discrediting of the Church relates to contemporary Irish secularization. ",

		"text": "States and traits: The meaning of uncertainty in nonreligious narratives Modernization narratives argue that belief and identity formation in modernity are riddled with uncertainty and instability; certainty is cast as a much desired, but considerably scarce commodity, while states of uncertainty and fluidity are theorized as disorienting and anxiety-inducing. The nonreligious, a sort of bell-weather group for these late-modern secular forms of belief and identity, offer an interesting case for exploring the empirical limits of this ideal-typed “modern” subject. Drawing on an analysis of identity narratives from 50 atheists, agnostics, and other nonreligious Americans, I find that nonreligious organizations and discourses promote both uncertainty and certainty, fostering a spectrum of active identifications and critical uncertainties. I argue that there is more certainty for the nonreligious than our theoretical narratives would predict, much of which is created by the politicization of certainty by nonreligious organizations. I also show that uncertainty and liminality can be intentional nonreligious choices that lead to meaningful worldviews and social engagement. And I reveal how nonreligious individuals often fluctuate between states of certainty and uncertainty regarding their nonreligious beliefs, making it useful to distinguish between certainty and uncertainty as both potentially stable traits as well as transitional or liminal states. Atheist Churches: All of the Community with “None” of the Theology Many have shown that religious involvement is one of the most common gateways into other forms of civic and community involvement in America, with the church being both a physical and ideological anchor around which community and morality are built. As younger cohorts are associating with organized religion less and less, many fear that America is in a “crisis of community” in which an increase in individualism and a decrease in religious affiliation has led to a decline in group membership and social networks, which in turn has led to a decline in reciprocity and trust amongst Americans. However, instead of retreating from community involvement, a large portion of these “nones” are instead forming their own voluntary associations, even churches, in response to a lack of secular outlets for community and civic engagement. This research is an ethnographic exploration of one of these communities - The Sunday Assembly. Founded in 2013 and dubbed an “atheist church” by the media, this group expects to have 100 “assemblies” worldwide by the end of 2014. Through in-depth interviews with organizers and members of one smaller, local group, as well as participant observation at their gatherings, I explore how this group is both copying and re-molding the church model in order to build a secular community around bettering themselves and their communities without invoking religious ideologies, in many ways complicating the crisis of community thesis. I will detail key findings from the first eight months of observations and interviews, fleshing out how one assembly is navigating their way through the logistics of becoming an organization while simultaneously fostering an emotionally and socially engaged community.

Each polity is distinct and multifaceted, yet their historical, social, cultural and religious links, and their shared ‘Celtic fringe’ status, combine to build a strong case for treating them as fruitful sites for the comparative study of ‘unbelief’— ‘used in a wide sense, implying a generalized lack of belief in a God or gods’ (Lee and Bullivant 2016). In this paper, I introduce my ongoing postdoctoral project which conceptualizes ‘unbelief’ as both discursive and political and includes fieldwork in four sites: a village and provincial town in each region. I will first focus upon the methodological hurdles involved in approaching ‘unbelief’ beyond metropolitan centres and argue that contestations surrounding ‘sacred’ values (Knott 2013) can be productive sites for the empirical study of ‘un/belief’. Second, I will address my core research questions considering my ongoing empirical work and analysis: 1) Does ‘unbelief’ look and function in the same way for people from Catholic, Protestant and other religious backgrounds? 2) Does ‘unbelief’ differ between rural areas and metropolitan centres? 3) Do societies characterized by long traditions of  tianity and politicized religious identifications produce particular practices and processes of ‘unbelief’? 4) Where and how do these relate to other social practices and processes of individuals, groups and communities in these two contexts? This paper speaks particularly to theme two of the Cultures of Unbelief conference. It represents an updated version of paper that was accepted for presentation at the BASR-ISASR conference in Belfast, September 2018, which was subsequently withdrawn due to my role as conference organizer and chair of the panel ‘Unbelief Across Borders’.  The Critical Study of Nonreligion: An Invitation In this post, NSRN Co-Director     places contemporary non-religion studies into conversation with the critical study of religion, assessing two dominant approaches in the field before extolling the virtues of a discursive approach as one way in which rigorous empirical work can be conducted ostensibly under the religion/non-religion binary and contribute to the critical project. Functionally Secular / Substantively Nonreligious: Scottish Students, their Secular Sacreds, the Sacred Secular The academic study of religion and related categories is populated with reified, mutually constitutive, and superficially synonymous dichotomies – religion/secular, sacred/profane, sacred/secular, religion/nonreligion – yet each serves a distinct, contextually dependent purpose. In this presentation I shall utilise a case study amongst notionally ‘nonreligious’ undergraduate students, in combination with a discussion of these dichotomies, to problematise the complex relationship between nonreligion and the secular. When asked about their beliefs and ‘religious’ identities, many of these students were substantively nonreligious (utilising Lois Lee’s understanding of nonreligion as defined primarily by the way it differs from religion). This nonreligiosity manifested itself in divers ways, dependent upon idiosyncratic interpretations of ‘religion’, and always linked to particular ‘secular sacreds’, which corresponded to five distinct-yet-overlapping nonreligious types. Individual narratives exemplify pragmatic negotiation of nonreligious identities, ‘fluctuation’ in nonreligious beliefs, and the rhetorical creation of religious ‘others’ against which substantive nonreligiosity was  constructed. In terms of salience and practice, many of these students appeared functionally secular i.e. ‘being nonreligious’ was generally unimportant and had little impact upon day-to-day life. However, the interaction of religion with personal sacreds precipitated the recognition and reaffirmation of subjective nonreligiosity. In many cases, the sacred in question was the ‘secular’ itself, which was profaned by the incursion of religion into individual narratives. This overview of the complex dynamics between these terms provides empirical clarification of the relationship between nonreligion and the secular, and demonstrates that nonreligion is a substantive phenomenon in its own right and, as such, an important component of secular society. . I am engaged in a year-long research project amongst selected undergraduate students at the University of Edinburgh. This research will be based on a combination of questionnaires, complemented by in-depth follow-up interviews with selected participants. Students are in a period of transition on numerous levels: familial, social, financial and intellectual, to name but a few. I intend to analyse the impact of these transitions on the process of becoming nonreligious/maintaining an irreligious stance. In addition, I address the impact of education on religiosity, and of academic subject area upon the irreligious turn, and intend to delve into the nuanced “varieties of nonreligion” expressed within the university, the conflicting understandings of key definitional terms, and the perceptions and preconceptions of, and about, the irreligious. I hope to demonstrate a dynamic relationship between religiosity and nonreligiosity, to confirm or challenge extant theories on the effects of education, subject area, financial situation and social situation on the nonreligious turn, and address underlying problems of definition, perception and expression of the varieties of nonreligion.

		"text": "From secular bodies to secular affects: Understanding cultures of unbelief through affect theory This paper considers the relevance of affect theory for exploring cultures of unbelief. In “Is There a Secular Body?” Charles Hirschkind asks if we can identify “a particular configuration of the human sensorium—of sensibilities, affects, embodied dispositions—specific to secular subjects, and thus constitutive of what we mean by ‘secular society’?” (633) Building on the work of scholars such as Saba Mahmood, Ann Pellegrini, and William Connolly—who have begun the task of connecting affect theory and critical secularism studies—I will argue that affect theory offers a new vocabulary for assessing cultures of unbelief according to their plural affective coordinates. As Charles Taylor has written, one of the central tasks of reconsidering secularism is the move away from “subtraction stories,” in which the extrication of religion leaves a neutral landscape of pure reason untouched by the residue of history. Rather than understanding this residue as vestigial conceptual or metaphysical frameworks, affect theory calls attention to the ways historical change may rewrite a set of beliefs while leaving “the way things feel” untouched, or the ways a shift in what Raymond Williams calls “structures of feeling” can alter the social coordinates of a culture while its metaphysical commitments remain constant. This sets up a rich typology for describing cultures of unbelief according to their affective makeup and building more fruitful comparisons (whether focusing on contrast or continuity) with religious cultures. This is illustrated by a historical case study: the initial design of the Sheldonian Theatre in the late 1660s in Oxford. During the middle ages, the University of Oxford primarily relied on the Church of St. Mary the Virgin for corporate activities, including boisterous spectacles like convocation ceremonies. The Sheldonian was commissioned by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, to create a secular site for such events, avoiding the scandal of a single structure wherein “sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo.” (Newman, “The Architectural Setting,” 161) To describe cultures of unbelief, we must not only examine our intuitions about what secularism “feels like,” but also consider the affective topographies that organize different formations of the secular.

		"text": "Cultural repertoires of nonreligion In a recent summary and review of sociological research on religion, I call for a cultural approach and articulate a research agenda centered on understanding cultural repertoires of religion (religious repertoires). In this paper I argue that a cultural approach to non-religion centered on non-religious repertoires is a useful approach to understanding unbelief.  I explain why this approach avoids the analytical problems associated with a secularization perspective on unbelief, including assumptions of linearity, the idea that unbelief is adequately characterized as an absence or a lack of religion and its attendant associations with community and morality, and the problematic characterization of modernity as entailing a sharp break with the past. Then I outline four ways in which the cultural repertoires approach can focus the attention of researchers in productive ways in growing field of scholarship on unbelief.  First, I discuss how this approach is responsive to the polysemous, contingent, and variable nature of unbelief, which may draw selectively on elements of both religious and secular traditions and combine them in new ways.  Second, I show how this approach directs our attention to unbelief as fostered by an array of organized fields of activity, from explicitly secular to spiritual, religious, and other voluntary organizations.  Third, this approach draws attention to the interconnections between unbelief and practice, including the ritualization and practices of connection and community-building.  Fourth, inherent within this approach is a focus on the importance of understanding variations shaped by national context, regional context, and individuals’ social location within a matrix of identity positions.  In summary, by focusing on nonreligious repertoires, I show that we can make strides in consolidating and expanding our understanding of a classical sociological problem, what C. Wright Mills called the understanding of lives in historical context, by centering the meanings of unbelief within and across social context.  Atheists Still Others? A 10-year Followup on the Findings of the American Mosaic Project In a major national survey fielded in 2003, atheists were named as the least trusted group in American society when compared to a range of other religious and racial out-groups. Michele Lamont has argued that moral worthiness is an important form of social capital in the United States, and religiosity has served as a kind of proxy for this social capital in both private and public life (e.g. for being a good neighbor, or a good citizen). Religion serves as a basis for cultural membership in American life, and a stated rejection of religion (e.g. the affirmation of an atheist identity) serves to define and sharpen a key symbolic boundary that separates authentic/good/true citizens from inauthentic/ problematic ones. In the spring of 2014, a 10-year follow-up survey was fielded by the Boundaries in the American Mosaic project team. In this paper, I compare the findings on religious outsiders in 2014 with those from 2003. Attitudes towards atheists have not changed appreciably in that ten-year time frame, despite the rising percentage and visibility of those claiming no religious identity (the “nones”). In this analysis, I first compare the determinants of atheist distrust in 2003 and 2014 with a special focus on the intersection of age and religiosity. Second, I compare the determinants of atheist distrust with those factors predicting distrust of other small religious out-groups (Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons). My aim is to further our understanding of the role of religiosity in designating insider/ outsider status in American life. ",

		"text": "Minority millennials and disaffiliation from religious communities: What unbelief means for millennials in the 21st century Why do America’s youngest generation disaffiliate from religious communities? How do disaffiliated minority millennials and Generation Z (Gen Z) view religion? How do they navigate their largely religious ethnic communities? Previous research has examined the religiosity of communities of color. However, there is a rising trend of unbelief among Gen Z and minority millennials. This research project investigates the diversity of unbelief among minority millennials and Gen Z; specifically, Filipino-Americans, the second-largest Asian-American group; African-Americans; and Hispanic-Americans. Through 45 in-depth interviews, the following three themes emerge across the interviews: 1) Race and Religion: “Fitting In” and Cultural Hegemony or Cultural Incompatibility and Unbelief; 2) Problematic History, Race, and Religion: The Legacy of Slavery; 3) Cultural Cost of Unbelief: Negotiating Family. Gen Z and minority millennials express skepticism due to past histories related to the church and subsequently question whether their respective race “fits in” with their religion. Despite these criticisms, most minority millennials and Gen Z report themselves as spiritual. Culturally, they tend to highly regard their parents and grandparents, who tend to be deeply religious. Because of these intergenerational ties, they are unlikely to “come out” as unbelievers in the church. This paper also explores the secularization theory and finds support for the multiple secularities hypothesis. ",

		"text": "Unbelief throughout history: Studying atheism in ancient Greece It is undeniable that the study of unbelief is receiving much attention in the last decades. The diverse works about the non-religious positions have shown the complexity of the phenomenon of unbelief. The principal aim of this communication is to conceptualize unbelief as a historical notion, principally in Ancient Greece, emphasizing the importance of the religious context in which atheistic positions are developed. The paper is divided into two main parts. The first one focuses on the concept of unbelief, its definition and its methodological potential. Unbelief is a concept particularly used in modern context. However, this paper proposes to apply the term in ancient times. Establishing unbelief as a religious-related field allow us to expand the scope to analyse atheistic positions in “premodern” times. The second part of this analysis is focused on the term “atheism”. In this work, atheism is defined as one of the philosophical positions included in the notion of unbelief. Atheistic positions that consist of denying the nature or the existence of the God or gods are understood as specific philosophical claims of the unbelievers. As so many authors have claimed, atheism cannot be stated as a universal phenomenon. It is a complex position that differs depending on its historical and religious context, especially in how the idea of God or gods has been developed. On the other hand, atheism is not (always) an antireligious position. An unbeliever in the idea of God, an atheist, can be also a believer in other religious elements, for example, soul or a magic force. In that regard, if we connect the complexity of unbelief and the variety of atheism, we can analyse the notion of unbelief in different historical contexts taking into account the peculiarities of each historical “chronotope”, in this case, the religious context of Ancient Greece.

		"text": "A cross-national exploration of the roots of unbelievers’ views on morality There is a widespread cross-cultural stereotype suggesting that atheists are untrustworthy and lack a moral compass. Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2-3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief -- analytic cognitive style. ",

		"text": "Cultures of unbelief in the case of Oslo In my research, ‘culture’ plays an important part on different levels. Non-religion itself is culturally contingent (Lee 2012 and Quack 2014). In Quack’s methodology ‘non-religion’ is culturally contingent in the sense that the social formation of ‘nones’ happens against and in relation to ‘neighbouring discursive fields’. The most immediately imagined fields are those of dominating religious traditions in a given society. However, I have discovered that it is adequate – if not to say necessary – to explore other fields as well to fully understand contemporary non-religious identities in Oslo. One possible way of approaching this, which I have followed in my research, is the importance of culture in the post-industrial city and how it affects meaning-making in everyday life. In this, ‘culture’ is understood both as it is involved in ethnic compositions of different ‘cultural’ traditions (this is ‘culture’ as in ‘multiculture’), including the religious components, but also how culture plays a role in urban area discourses, which is related to consumerism and a, relatively speaking, new fashion of engaging with urban life, which perhaps is better understood as cultures of postmodernity. The former tells us a lot about how nones perceive their own (non-)religiosity and their perceptions of the religious other, while the latter can teach us a lot about how nones make sense of their everyday life and beyond. This is my methodological proposition: that there is much to learn from exploring discursive fields in which various approaches to ‘culture’ as a concept plays an important part when aiming to understand ‘non-religion’ in all its varieties. In particular, to understand the purportedly ‘indifferent’ stand to faith and worldviews in Scandinavia (e.g. addressed by Zuckerman 2008) we need to investigate how culture itself is changing alongside more ‘obvious’ transformations in the religious landscape. In this paper I will show how this conceptualisation of culture is instrumental for my analysis of the social formation of non-religious identities in Oslo by portraying a sample of different profiles, in which gender, class and ethnicity is decisive.  Who’s the Master of None? The misfits ticking off 'none’ when asked about religious affiliation. An unrecognised chunk of diverging identities: It’s time to ask how the non-religious are recognised in state, law and politics. ",

Many studies have linked regular attendance in a congregation with socially desirable outcomes, such as happiness, health and civic engagement. But does religion make a discernible difference in the lives of those who are not actively religious? Are those who still hang on to a religious identity distinct from those who don’t hold such an identity? In this presentation, I will share results from Pew Research Center analysis of 34 countries with sizeable populations of people who are actively religious (who claim a religious identity and attend services at least monthly), inactively religious (who claim a religious identity and who attend services infrequently) and who claim no religious identity (“nones”). In 27 of the 34 countries studied, the actively religious are a minority of the adult population: Especially in Europe, but also in some countries of Asia and the Pacific, levels of affiliation are declining and regular attendance at religious services is relatively rare. In many economically advanced countries, the share of “nones” has been rapidly increasing, while the share of inactively religious people has declined. How will societies change in the future if the inactively religious share of the population continues to shrink and the percentage that is religiously unaffiliated grows? This presentation will consider differences between inactives and nones before and after demographic characteristics of each group are taken into account as well as how results vary across the quite different national contexts studied. . .

In Study 1, three unbeliever groups were identified: Analytic atheists (with no supernatural beliefs and strong analytic thinking), spiritual but not religious individuals (relying on intuitions and endorsing cognitive biases and supernatural beliefs), and uncertain nonbelievers (falling between the two groups). Studies 2–5 are in progress. In Study 2, participants chose often atheist, nonreligious, agnostic or irreligious as their identification. Less than 10% identified as secular, religious, spiritual but not religious, or spiritual seeker. These eight groups had different attitudes toward religion in terms of evaluation and attitude importance, ambivalence and interest. Study 3 shows that having a simple view of knowledge and trusting personal justification in religion predicts seeing science and religion as conflicting whereas endorsing cognitive biases and viewing religion to be important for society predicts the non-conflict view. Studies 4 and 5 are EEG studies. Study 4 investigates implicit attitudes towards religious and spiritual topics in different groups of unbelievers. Study 5 investigates to what extent different unbelievers endorse implicit supernatural beliefs, by having participants evaluate different supernatural belief concepts in either a belief or a disbelief context.

The Diversity of Unbelief in Northern and Central Europe — An Early Analysis Surveys shows that unbelievers have a distinctive profile compared to the general population on several indicators related to sociality, collective identity and cultural transmission.

The sample includes environments which have experienced rapid (Netherlands) and gradual (UK) secularization, in cosmopolitan and parochial environments (big cities and small towns), and in environments that have high and low levels of unbelief. In analysing our data, we will bring new theoretical perspectives to the study of unbelief, beginning by using  ’s theory of religious publicisation (2011). Belonging Without Believing? New research reports that 53% of the British public now describe themselves as having “no religion”. In this media response blog,     comments on his research on the Sunday Assembly London in this post-Christian transition. Reimagining the Secular: The Sunday Assembly - Belonging without Believing. Grace Davie (1994) famously wrote over two decades ago that 'the overall pattern of religious life is changing. For it appears that more and more people within British Society want to believe but do not want to involve themselves in religious practice.’ Hence, the catchphrase 'believing without belonging’ was coined. Twenty-two years later has the (non)religious landscape changed once again? My doctoral research follows the Sunday Assembly, a secular congregation that celebrates life, with the motto: live better, help often and wonder more. Their vision is: to help everyone live life as fully as possible. The Sunday Assembly entered the non-religious market place in January 2013 with their flagship London congregation. Now, 68- franchised chapters of the Godless congregation exist in 8 different countries, attempting to provide community, belonging and wonder to the religiously unaffiliated market. Once described as 'the best bits of church but with no religion and with awesome pop songs!’, the best bits literally borrow established successful terminology, practices, liturgies and models of building community found within Christian churches. Often labelled oxymoronically the 'atheist church’ - it parallels and mimics the functionality of church life without the need for a deity. Therefore, studying the Sunday Assembly may offer a new variation to Davie’s 'believing without belonging’ that is 'belonging without believing.’ As more and more people now identify as being non-religious in the United Kingdom and America, this paper will aim to answer what factors are enticing people towards the Sunday Assembly and their nonreligious practice. This paper will present findings from my analysis of the Sunday Assembly. Drawing upon 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews and a year-long ethnography spent with the London Sunday Assembly congregation. ",

Ex- and non-religious outsiders in the Norwegian 'Bible belt’ The medium-sized city Kristiansand, known as capital of Norway’s southern 'Bible belt’, is the municipal centre of a region associated with a high degree of religious profession and practice, where the social order associates high status and political and economic power with evangelical Christianity and conservative family structures. The project Cultural Conflict 2.0 investigates how social media tends to reproduce social order rather than – as it is often assumed – providing platforms for construing one’s own identities and breaking down social barriers. Drawing partly on the figurational sociology of Norbert Elias, this paper presents data from an ongoing investigation of the “established” and “outsiders” in Kristiansand, and the reproduction of these categories in various social media. Among Kristiansand’s 'outsiders’ are young former members of local conservative Christian congregations. The mediated (and not) performances of this loosely defined group provides a case study in how non-religious identities and networked communities are construed not (only) based on explicit rejection of religion, but also in negotiation with a particular social order that happens to carry locally specific 'religious’ overtones.

		"text": "Studying nonreligion academically: An overview of the current methodological challenges for the study of nonbelieving individuals The study of nonreligion has been steadily gaining popularity in the Academy during the past decade, giving rise to an ever-growing number of studies about nonreligious individuals and their characteristics, as well as multiple theories striving to explain the sharp rise and outcomes of nonbelief in society. Clarifying what qualifies as ‘nonreligion’, however, is proving to be a challenge for scholars currently working on the topic, resulting into an abundance of publications attempting to pinpoint and define the research object in a variety of manners. This paper will address such current challenges for the field of nonbelief studies by looking at a variety of ways ‘nonreligion’ is approached and defined in an academic context. Focusing on the differences that occur between quantitative and qualitative approaches to nonbelief – both in terms of defining the research subject-matter and methodologically – it aims to showcase how even slight dissimilarities in definitions and methods can yield widely different results. Along with that, the presentation will also illustrate some of the main theoretical challenges and common assumptions of scholars working in the field and argue in favor of a “relational approach” (Quack, 2014) when exploring the nonreligious.

		"text": "Angels and the Digital Afterlife: Death and Nonreligion Online This brief article aims to draw the attention of nonreligion researchers to a growing interdisciplinary research field: the study of death online. In digitally networked societies, the dead are remembered online, and their survivors can use digital resources to express grief, find support and construct memorials. New norms and languages of mourning are emerging, including new references to heaven, angels and communication with the dead. The boundary between religion and nonreligion is blurred in these new practices, but we know very little as yet about what this blurring actually means to the bereaved. This article will outline the main approaches to religion in studies of death online, draw on nonreligion research to critique these approaches, and call for new directions and methods in future studies of nonreligion and media. It will argue that scholars of religion and nonreligion have much to offer to the study of death online, and this article acts as an introduction and an invitation to future interdisciplinary exploration. Angels and the Digital Afterlife: Studying Nonreligion Online In the second instalment of the SSNB/NSRN methods blog,     argues that the scope and significance of digital methodologies for the study of – and beyond – 'nonreligion’ is much broader and more promising than is often perceived.

		"text": "Stumbling Upon the Nones While studying the impact of social media on social relations in a medium-sized Norwegian city, and the formation of local social media clusters, our team of researchers stumbled upon a group of ex- and non-religious persons, which made us re-examine issues of majority-minority relations. Ex- and non-religious outsiders in the Norwegian 'Bible belt’ The medium-sized city Kristiansand, known as capital of Norway’s southern 'Bible belt’, is the municipal centre of a region associated with a high degree of religious profession and practice, where the social order associates high status and political and economic power with evangelical Christianity and conservative family structures. The project Cultural Conflict 2.0 investigates how social media tends to reproduce social order rather than – as it is often assumed – providing platforms for construing one’s own identities and breaking down social barriers. Drawing partly on the figurational sociology of Norbert Elias, this paper presents data from an ongoing investigation of the “established” and “outsiders” in Kristiansand, and the reproduction of these categories in various social media. Among Kristiansand’s 'outsiders’ are young former members of local conservative Christian congregations. The mediated (and not) performances of this loosely defined group provides a case study in how non-religious identities and networked communities are construed not (only) based on explicit rejection of religion, but also in negotiation with a particular social order that happens to carry locally specific 'religious’ overtones.

		"text": "Questions You Should Never Ask an Atheist: Towards Better Measures of Nonreligion and Secularity As interest in the nonreligious has grown, attention has turned to how to measure both the growth of and variation within the nonreligious. This interest has also revealed that prior measures of religiosity are often problematic. In this research note, I detail some of these problems. For instance, some measures fail to contrast nonreligiosity with religiosity. Other measures are double-barreled or one-and-a-half barreled, making them impossible for nonreligious individuals to answer. Finally, I note that how questions are worded can result in very different estimates of how many nonreligious people and atheists there are in a population. Making Secularization Predictive: A Qualitative Comparative Analytic Test While there have been many iterations of secularization theory, more recent versions of the theory have addressed prior criticisms and are now in a position to be formalized. In this paper I formalize some of the propositions of secularization theory and use those propositions to generate a number of specific hypotheses that can be derived from the broader theory. I focus specifically on factors that inhibit or facilitate macro-level secularization and then test the hypotheses using data from nearly all sovereign nation-states in the world. Utilizing a configurational comparative method, I find that, certain sets of propositions set forth as conditions of secularization consistently explain the level of secularization in countries around the world. Based on these findings I suggest that there is growing support for modern iterations of secularization theory. Organized Secularism in the United States: New Directions in Research There has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of the US population that is not religious. However, there is, to date, very little research on the social movement that is organizing to serve the needs of and advocate for the nonreligious in the US. This is a book about the rise and structure of organized secularism in the United States. By organized secularism we mean the efforts of nonreligious individuals to build institutions, networks, and ultimately a movement that serves their interests in a predominantly religious society. Researchers from various fields address questions such as: What secularist organizations exist? Who are the members of these organizations? What kinds of organizations do they create? What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past? And what is their likely impact on the future of secularism? For anyone trying to understand the rise of the nonreligious in the US, this book will provide valuable insights into organized efforts to normalize their worldview and advocate for their equal treatment in society. No One Expects a Transgender Jew: Religious, Sexual and Gendered Intersections in the Evaluation of Religious and Nonreligious Others While a large body of research has established that there is substantial prejudice against atheists and nonreligious individuals, both in the US and in other countries where nonreligious people are minorities, to date very little research has looked beyond attitudes toward solitary identities (e.g., “atheists” vs. “gay atheists”). Given the growing recognition of the importance of intersectionality in understanding the experiences of minorities, in this article we examined attitudes toward intersected identities, combining five (non)religious identities (i.e., Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, and nonreligious) with four sexual/gender identities (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender) using a 100-point thermometer scale (N = 618). We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were religious identities, with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non)religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” religious identities, unless those religious identities are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious. You Get What You Ask For: The Importance of Question Wording in Surveys In the latest instalment of the NSRN/SSNB Methods series, sociologist       considers bad, better and best ways of asking interview questions about religious affiliation and belief. Time to name a movement? In this post,     asks if it is time to give nonreligious movements a name. If so, what might this name be? And how, as an academic, can he avoid the pitfalls of labeling a group from the outside – rather than from within. “Splitters!”: Lessons from Monty Python for Nontheist/ Freethought Organizations in the US While the 19th century saw a wave of popularity for freethinkers in the US, much of this excitement had died down by the early part of the 20th century. Just a handful of nontheist and freethought organizations remained, and most of them were very small and on the verge of collapsing. However, starting in 1941 with the founding of the American Humanist Association and followed by the founding of American Atheists in 1963, the number of nontheist organizations experienced a slow increase. Today, there are several large, national, member-based nontheist/freethought social movement organizations in the US and thousands of smaller, local organizations. In this paper we examine the origins and inter-relations of four of the largest nontheist/freethought organizations in the US: the American Humanist Association, American Atheists, the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. In examining the origins of these organizations, we draw upon several social movement theories but also extend current theorizing by discussing the importance of inter-personal relationships for understanding how social movement organizations “split” or “fracture”. We also discuss whether these “splits” facilitate or hinder the aims of the broader movement in the US. Does Atheist Movement Activism Increase Interest in Atheism? Do the activities of American Atheists lead to an increased interest in atheism? In our latest blog post     discusses his statistical analysis of correlations between American Atheist activity and Google searches for the term ‘atheist’. Forms, Frequency, and Correlates of Perceived Anti-Atheist Discrimination The nationally representative 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that 41% of self-identified atheists reported experiencing discrimination in the last 5 years due to their lack of religious identification.  This mixed-method study explored the forms and frequency of discrimination reported by 796 self-identified atheists living in the United States.  Participants reported experiencing different types of discrimination to varying degrees, including slander; coercion; social ostracism; denial of opportunities, goods, and services; and hate crime.  Similar to other minority groups with concealable stigmatized identities, atheists who more strongly identified with their atheism, who were “out” about their atheism to more people, and who grew up with stricter familial religious expectations reported experiencing more frequent discrimination.  Implications for future research tied to the ongoing religion/spirituality-health debate are discussed. Pro-Religion Hegemony This paper analyzes terminology in the sociology of religion to illustrate proreligious hegemony and the construction of deviant identities for the non-religious. The paper begins by analyzing the current terminology used to refer to the non-religious and makes suggestions for less-biased terminology. The article then uses the “found” terminology to illustrate how language and definitions function to marginalize the non-religious and turn them into a deviant, denigrated category in the sociology of religion. . My current research focuses on individuals who report no identification with organized religion, but also do not associate with a pro-secular or pro-atheist group. This work will form the basis of a chapter in a book on secularism that is part of the 'Future of Religion in America' book series that will be published over the next few years by Columbia University Press. The basic goal of the chapter is to get a sense of what the ordinary, everyday lives of Nones are: what do they do instead of go to church, what are their hobbies, how do they derive their ethics and morals, how do they think about religious people, and how do they manager their non-religious identity in a predominantly religious society like the U.S. There have been a number of studies that have focused on Nones and seculars who are affiliated with pro-secular or pro-atheist groups, but nothing, to date, that focuses on nones without this connection, and particularly on their everyday lives. We are hoping to interview between 20 and 50 diverse people for this project and have a small grant from my university to pay participants and transcribe the interviews. As part of this project I am including a sub-component that gets at my bigger interest in the role of social networks in religious disidentification. We developed a section of the interview to allow us to explore the religiosity of members of participants' social networks over their lifetime to explore idea. ",

		"text": "Undoing un/belief: an orthodox Jewish perspective In this blog,     shares some reflections emerging from her work, Jewish unbelief in contemporary Britain, which explores the meanings of 'unbelief’, within minority British contexts. On Learning from the Margins: Jewish Nonreligious Grammars within a Secular-Protestant Landscape This contribution to the special issue draws on ethnographic fieldwork exploring pluralities of Jewish life across adjacent urban neighbourhoods in London in order to engage with the conceptual questions and empirical omissions that are currently of concern to scholars of nonreligion. Learning from some illustrative moments in my fieldwork in which articulations of non-belief in God serendipitously arose, I first consider how marginal Jewish perspectives trouble the conceptual framing of 'religion/nonreligion’ within (post)Protestant cultures. I then show how an ethnographic approach focused on the specific contexts in which piety or belief in God is othered can deepen understanding of the heterogeneous formations of 'nonreligion’, even within relatively well-researched settings such as contemporary London. . My PhD project is looking at student engagement with Israel-Palestine within UK university campuses. My work relates to the study of non-religion in the sense that the project will look interactions between student groups who self-define in terms of religion, culture and political commitments and this may include 'non-religious' groups such as student Atheist societies if they are involved with the issue on campuses. I hope that through focusing on an issue which is variously portrayed as a 'religious' 'ethnic' and 'political' conflict, and which engages students in moral discourse, the project will provide an opportunity to explore the moral and symbolic frameworks and values constructed and contested among students who identify as religious or non-religious.

		"text": "Grounding Non-Theological Morality: The Victorian Secularist Movement, Secular Ethics, and Human Progress This article examines the formation of British Secularist ethics in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The Secularist movement, initiated by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851, was a primarily artisan working-class social movement that sought to ground social ethics upon a rational, scientific, and non-theological foundation. This article examines how the quest for a science of morals informed Secularist expectations and judgements. In this article, I trace how the idea of a rational science of ethics was integrated into the secularist movement. I begin by briefly situating the Secularist movement within the wider moral and epistemological debates of the mid-Victorian period. I address the implications that atheism had on the development of Secularism, and on its contemporary reputation and respectability. I then examine how Holyoake sought to establish the non-theological grounds of morality and the tensions that arose from debates between Secularists regarding the necessity of atheism to Secularism. Finally, I argue that despite significant fissures within the movement created by the question of the necessity of atheism, Secularism nevertheless evinced a high degree of conceptual unity concerning the nature and grounds of morality.

This is an especially important gap in the religion/secularism research because religiosity appears to be declining throughout the Western world (Zuckerman, Galen & Pasquale, 2016). Despite stereotypes of atheists as atomized, psychologically unhealthy and anti-social (e.g., Bainbridge, 2005), a growing body of evidence suggests that strongly-identified atheists are more likely to join secular social clubs as well as benefit from better mental and physical health compared to less affirmatively-identified secular individuals. As a step toward developing this line of research, the present article operationalizes social network structure within the study of secularism, discusses the available research with a focus on atheism in particular, and integrates this research into a schematic theoretical model of atheist self-identity, network structure and health.

This paper investigates how negatively defining an out-group is important, if not integral, for creating a shared identity among members of ideologically based social groups. To explore this connection, I interviewed undergraduate student members of a Christian club and an atheist club at a Midwestern research university. I examined the strength of group identification, how members revealed shared identity, and patterns regarding how participants characterize out-group members. My findings suggest that atheists characterized Christians as less rational and in need of external comfort more than themselves, whereas Christians described atheists as disturbed by suffering and the behavior of some self-identified Christians. Defining one’s in-group and reaffirming the correctness and inherent social benefit of the in-group’s views were essential components of out-group characterizations. ",

		"text": "Politics, Individualism, and Atheism: An Examination of the Political Attitudes of Atheist Activists in a Canadian City Given the growth of atheism in the Western world (including activist organizations), and atheists becoming more political, it is essential to understand the identities and values that motivate atheist activism. One avenue for exploring these identities and values is through an examination of individual political attitudes. Although the scholarship on atheist activists’ political attitudes is limited, some scholars have identified the apparent growth of right-wing sentiments within the US atheist movement (LeDrew 2016). Others have identified a contentious relationship between prominent atheists’ political attitudes and egalitarian views (e.g., anti-sexism and anti-racism) (Amarasingam, Amarnath, and Brewster 2016). Of those scholars who have commented on atheists’ viewpoints, most emphasize the liberalism of the broader population of atheists. The purpose of this article is to examine the political attitudes of atheist activists in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and highlight a core set of political attitudes and values that atheists share despite intra-movement disagreements about the relationship between atheist identity and political ideology. My findings show that some Canadian atheist activists’ share a cluster of liberal and Enlightenment ideals that includes personal liberty, individualism, and an absolutist view of free expression. This article will be of interest to scholars of atheist activism as well as social movement scholars. ",

		"text": "Social Class and the Stubbornness of Family Myths: How Nonbeliever and Pagan Parents Cope with Intrusions on Parenting by Proselytizing Christian Family Members in the U.S. Bible Belt Family scholars have documented how powerful institutions intrude upon marginalized parents. Yet, few have examined the effect that intrusion on parenting takes on a more intimate level. Guided by insights from theories of emotion management and family inequality, I compare how two religiously marginalized groups in the Bible Belt cope with a ubiquitous experience they face as parents—unwelcomed proselytizing by Christian family members. Based on participant-observation and forty in-depth interviews, I document nonbeliever and Pagan parents’ experiences with proselytizing by Christian family members to be common, intrusive, and often perceived as potentially harmful to children. Failing to enforce desired boundaries between children and proselytizers, many parents resort to constructing narratives of equality to describe a condition of inequality. They do so by claiming a “we just don’t talk about religion” arrangement. This narrative, though seemingly equitable, serves as a family myth, obscuring painful truths about power and inequality. Nonbeliever and Pagan parents differ in their reliance on this rhetoric. While nonbeliever parents cling to the family myth as an emotion management device, Pagans more readily acknowledge the “we just don’t talk about religion” strategy as more fiction than fact. I analyze how differences in social class explain nonbelievers’ and Pagans’ differing levels of commitment to this family myth. I place this phenomenon within the culture of Christian hegemony in the Bible Belt, where proselytizing is normative and prevailing norms of privatization within parenting are overridden by a culture of evangelism.

		"text": "“Raising secularism”: Secular educational activism in Turkey The educational system has recently become one of the most fervent subjects of the secularism versus-Islamism confrontation in Turkey, especially after the educational reforms initiated by the AKP government in line with the publicly announced target for “raising pious generations”. Several public demonstrations against the government’s educational reforms have been accompanied by the formation of parent organizations, NGOs and voluntary scientist and/or educator initiatives (such as online educational networks) for secular education. Besides, in the last decade, there has been an unparalleled increase in the number of private schools, some of which, using the supply of secular education as a marketing tool, have become a secular alternative for many parents. In this research, after summarizing the relevant qualitative and quantitative surveys to portray the big picture, I share the results of my semi-structured interviews with a group of activists (including parents) about their activities for and definitions of a proper secular education, their approaches towards the religion classes and the alternative offered by the private schools and voluntary networks. I examine whether different ideological, religious or class backgrounds of activists matter, and how? Finally, I raise two questions which also have implications for secularism in Turkey in general: Can we talk about “privatization of secularity”, considering the compensation of the lack of public secular education with private or voluntary institutions? Does the widespread mobilization for secular education represent a grassroot secularist movement in Turkey, which would challenge the widespread characterization of Turkish secularism as a set of officially-dictated, top-down policies lacking popular support and appealing only for cultural or economic elites?

		"text": "Trans-Religious Manifestations of the Secular: Revisiting the Concept of Blasphemy in Non-western Contexts This paper approaches religious controversy as a consequence of flawed and inconclusive processes of secularization in non-western contexts. In order to prove the validity of this approach, a comparative historical analysis of the implementation of secularism in India and Turkey is provided and the Rushdie affair is discussed as the case study that reveals the flawed and inconclusive evolution of secularism in both contexts. Reconceptualization of blasphemy as a socio-political concept rather than a religious one is suggested in consideration of the political reasons behind the affair as opposed to the merely religious/irreligious reasons that had been highlighted by state officials and the media. Implications of the case in both contexts are discussed throughout a critical discursive analysis of the narratives related to the affair. In conclusion, the paper argues that nation-building processes accompanying the implementation of secularism as state ideology in these non-western contexts have indirectly delegitimized religious freedom while serving the legitimation of oppressive majority religions, or particular versions of those, despite aspiring to foster religious freedom in theory.

		"text": "Do Religious Actors Use Public Reason? The Case of Assisted Dying in Britain The socially constructed nature of the 'religious’ and the 'secular’ spheres remains a contested and frequently politicised issue. A key feature of scholarly debate in this area centres around the discursive terms of entry of religion into the public square, and the extent to which Rawlsian public (or secular) reason acts as a prerequisite for, and hence the only valid form of, democratic deliberation. At the present time, however, the character of these debates remains largely confined to a theoretical level, with little empirical research being conducted on the ways in which religious actors themselves actually engage in public discourse. This paper addresses these issues by analysing religious opposition to recent and on-going campaigns for the legalisation of assisted dying in Britain. Based on an analysis of debates centring on the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments, it shows that religious actors have tended towards the use of secular, as opposed to theological, modes of argumentation. This, the paper suggests, denotes a strategic shift on the part of religious actors, shaped by the increasingly diverse nature of the religion and belief landscape in which they operate. Sticks and Stones: The Use of Anti-Secular Discourse in Britain In this post,     discusses a rise of a strident anti-secular discourse in Britain. Intolorent secularist discourse is inherently anti-religious and wants to drive religion from the public space. Anti-secularist discourses, on the other hand have seen a rise in the promotion of religion in ‘public’ spaces.   explores the motives and agendas of these discourses. Faithless: The politics of new atheism The emergence of 'new atheism’ during the course of the last decade helped fuel an upsurge of interest in issues around religion. But scholarly analysis of new atheism, particularly its political dimensions, remains embryonic. This paper addresses this lacuna by examining the politics of new atheism across a variety of themes related to politics. These include the causal factors underpinning its emergence and development, its organisational structure and composition, the political strategies pursued by its proponents, and the various internal tensions and conflicts that these dynamics have produced.

		"text": "Secular magic: vanishing others in a secular age The theme of this conference—'secularisms’—suggests we know what we are looking for. But if the critical study of secularism or 'the secular’ during the last twenty years has shown one thing, it is secularism’s profound multivalence even (and perhaps especially) in the West. There are multiple ways of approaching secularism and the secular: as a mode of law (Hurd;  ; Pellegrini), a core facet of late-modern subjectivity (Taylor; Asad), a political ideology (Fitzgerald), an obfuscating mythology of the religious other (Cavanaugh). Which should be foregrounded in a search for 'other’ secularisms? What preconceptions condition the line we draw around our anticipated object of study? Can we 'provincialise’ the Western secular simply by locating other secularisms in other cultures? In this paper, I use my current research on the limitations (and failures) of an eminently Western study—Charles Taylor’s A secular age (2007)—as a cautionary tale about examining the secular from within the secular. For although Taylor appears to shine an objective light on what has brought us to our current 'secular age’, he still writes out of a set of coordinates driven by Eurocentric, secular self-understandings that do not recognise the profound role 'other’ religions have already played in the construction of Western secularity (Brown 2007; Mahmood 2010; Casanova 2010). Do we really understand the genealogy of our own 'secular’? Can we start looking for it elsewhere before we do? And what comparative 'magic’ (J. Z. Smith 1982) might be at play in the study of other secularisms? ",

		"text": "The Role of the Press in the Evolution of Secularism in the Arab World: The Case of al-Jinān (1870-1886) Secularism in the Arab World is a topic that has received wide scholarly attention, yet not many works have looked closely at its early evolution and the historical conditions of its emergence in the second half of the 19th C. The main historical narrative in this regard explains the formation of Arab secular thought as a reaction by a number of Christian intellectuals in the Levant against Muslim Ottoman rule. While the earliest expressions of secularism in the Arab world were indeed made by Christians, one cannot simply reduce their views to minoritarian politics. Such a narrative ignores several other important factors, such as the diverse attitudes of Arab Christians toward modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire and internal dynamics within Christian minorities, which witnessed intense debates and competitions, not only along confessional lines, but also socioeconomic and political; for example, between the clergy and the rising bourgeois laity. Within these debates and discussions, the newly emerging Arabic press played a crucial role in the formation, development, and dissemination of secular epistemic, social, and political categories. In this proposed paper, I shall examine this aspect taking al-Jinān journal (1870- 1886) as an example. Published in Beirut by Syrian intellectual and Protestant convert Butrus al-Bustani, al-Jinān was one of the earliest long-running and widely circulated periodicals in the Arab world. It followed a political line that supported Ottoman modernization, but was more explicit in grounding these reforms in notions of human progress and spirit of the age. Its political line will be contrasted with those of two other contemporary Beirut-based journals— al-Bashīr (published by the Jesuits) and Thamarāt al-Funūn (published by Islamic reformists)—in order to provide a picture of the ideological and political climate at the time.

		"text": "Multi-faced Religiosity: Negotiating shinkō (faith) and shūkyō (religion) in the secularised space of social welfare in Japan Recent scholarship on Japan addressed the historical process through which the category of religion was constructed through a “politically charged boundary-drawing exercise” (Josephson 2012) that codified its position vis-a-vis the 'secular’, resulting in a twofold differentiation running along the private-public divide. The separation between interior beliefs and their external manifestations intertwined with a discrimination of legitimacy between different forms of religiosity, such as commitment to a specific system of doctrine and practice versus non-denominational forms of religiosity partially admitted in the public space (Nishimura 2016). This process, far from resulting in a univocal definition of 'religion’, produced a multi-layered fragmentation which still marks this conceptual field of shinkō/shūkyō. Focusing on welfare activities promoted by the lay-Buddhist organisation Risshō Kōseikai, the paper will discuss how legal constraints and social conventions shape the way practitioners articulate their religiosity when operating in the secularised domain of social care. The need to comply with existing limitations leads to the adoption of strategies of “discursive secularization” (Rots 2017) through which members reformulate their engagement in neutral, less religiously-connoted terms. However, as boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate expressions of religiosity are not clearly drawn, the process is often accompanied by confusion and uneasiness in both practitioners and non-religious actors. The analysis aims to offer new insights not only on the process through which 'religion’ and 'the secular’ came to be constructed in Japan, but also on the ways in which these categories are experienced 'on the ground’ by religious practitioners operating in secularised spaces.  Negotiating Religion in Secularised Domains: Religiously Inspired Social Care in Japan In this post,       details how religious actors in Japan employ strategies of 'reflexive secularization’ in order to spread religious values in secularised public spaces.

		"text": "Contesting the 'Islamic' in Islamic Revival: Women Practicing Islamic Visual Arts in Istanbul, Turkey Questions pertaining to what is “Islamic” and what counts as “traditional” have gained more salience in the post-secular moment, with the unprecedented rise of Islamist movements around the globe. Behind these popular movements are not only political parties and grassroots organizing, but also the reinvigoration of a repertoire of cultural forms, images and historic references that add meaning to what constitutes “Islamic” in socially specific and gendered ways. This paper explores the cultural formations of Islamic revivalism in Turkey with a focus on the Islamic visual arts scene in Istanbul and from the perspective of women artists. Since the 1990s, Islamic visual arts have flourished at an unparalleled scale parallel to the rise of the pro-Islamist politics in Turkey. This creative practice has revived the aesthetic and ethical values, as well as histories, abandoned under the hegemony of Western culture since the early days of the republic, and contributed to the ongoing crisis and fragmentation of the vernacular secularism in Turkey. Importantly, increasing numbers of women artists have participated in this traditionally male-dominated art scene as they came to learn, teach and practice traditional art forms such as miniature, illumination, and calligraphy. In this art scene, artists, instructors, curators, directors, gallery owners and patrons come together to redefine the meaning of “Islamic” and negotiate the cultural boundaries of pursuing Sunni Islam, as well as breaking away from it. This research examines the Islamic and traditional art scene in Turkey as a complex counter-hegemonic space in the context of Islamic revivalism in response the dominant discourses of secularism and Islam in Turkey. It particularly looks at how women artists negotiate and reproduce the notion of “Islamic” and thereby challenge the patriarchal constructions of secularist and religious discourses. ",

		"text": "What possible meaning can the post-secular have? The disputed term 'post-secular’ is used as a descriptor for multiple ideas in diverse fields of research. If there is a commonality, it is that the term carries the implicit assertion that there is a particular 'secular' which has been 'transcended', immediately begging the questions of the particularisation of the secular and what form this transcendence is supposed to take. In his 2012 presidential address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, James Beckford critically appraised contemporary uses of the term, concluding that \"the literature on the postsecular is shot through with uncertainty about the question of whether it refers to a concept or a reality.\" Beckford sketched six groups of interpretation, which ranged from denial and apathy to zealous claims of the reintroduction of the transcendent into public dialogue. This paper revisits the theme of the post-secular, seeking to interrogate the term in the context of the dialectical relationships of religion / non-religion and secular / eternal.

		"text": "Islam as Religion and Secularity: Expressing a modern conceptual distinction from within a discursive tradition Muslims and non-Muslims alike often take Islam to be a religion that is more than just religion, to contain both the religious and the secular. This understanding, it should be clear, cannot possibly form part of an asserted timeless Islamic essence, since it only became meaningful once the modern conceptual pair of religion and the secular was operative (even though we may in hindsight retrace kernels of that pair to earlier historical moments). This paper attends to the formative period of the modern conceptual order in Arabic to show that Islam indeed came to refer to religion and the secular, but that this double reference of Islam could and can be used to validate the integration as well as the distinction of both spheres. Islamic intellectuals in the modern public sphere answered to the ubiquitous question concerning the relation of these two spheres by appropriating the Islamic discursive tradition to address both religion and the secular. Within this discursive arrangement, they could argue for varying degrees and points of distinction and connection between religion and the secular. I base my argument mainly on an analysis of the journal al-Manar, the widely influential mouthpiece of Islamic modernism that was published in Cairo between 1898 and 1940. I complement this by looking at secular actors who in the context of al-Manar validated Islam as culture and thereby contributed to the double reference of Islam to religion and the secular.

		"text": "A Secular Age in Modern India? Jawaharlal Nehru and the Question of Indian Secularity Jawaharlal Nehru’s modern and secular vision directly shaped independent India’s polity and society for seventeen years; initially heading the interim legislature (1947-52) and thereafter winning three successive general elections (1952, 1957, 1961). In the Nehruvian period the Indian polity and society saw an emphasis on state-led developmentalism, scientific temper, and a commitment to secularism. In this paper, I shall elaborate upon Nehru’s notion of secularity and his idea of secularism by identifying two dialectical strands of arguments in his reflection on the role of religion in state and society under modern conditions. One argument of secularity, I argue, can be located in his nationalist narrative about its cultural familiarity and suitability for the Indian society; and the other argument relies on the origin and success of secularity in the West and hence its emulation and desirability in modern India. I call the first secularity narrative 'the secular nationalist strand,’ and the second, 'the liberal-Western strand.’ I shall argue that both these strands of arguments were brought together by Nehru to construct a narrative of Indian secularity and to also argue that secularity as such is an universalisable ideal. Following Nehru’s narrative of secularity, I identify three features of Nehruvian secularism and also argue that the withering of Nehruvian type of secularism in contemporary India may be partially attributed to its inability to accommodate democratic politics that, since the 1980s, has been increasingly focussing on religious and other identarian issues, like caste.

		"text": "The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and the Categories of 'Religion(s)’ and 'Secularity’ The English term 'religion’ first arrived in Japan in the 1850’s, and became established as a social category by the 1880s. At this point, the category of religion denoted specifically Buddhism, sectarian Shinto, and Christianity. The realm of ostensibly 'non-religious’ national ethos of that time can be conceptualised as 'Shinto Secular’ (e.g. Josephson 2012). When Japan surrendered to the Allied powers at the end of the brutal Pacific War, in 1945, the pre-war 'Shinto Secular’ was quickly reconceptualised as 'State Shinto,’ and reclassified as 'religion.’ This signifies the construction of a new type of secularity, which replaced the former 'Shinto’ type. This paper examines the foundation of the post-war Japanese secularity through the critical reading of William Woodard’s The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and Japanese Religions (1972) as well as historical documents from the Occupation. What constitutes post-war Japanese secularity was strongly shaped by the value orientation of American liberal democracy. Importantly, it is the discourse on religion, as binary opposite of liberal democratic 'secularity,’ that naturalises the liberal democratic value orientations as if they represent the order of things and that equate the cultural norms of liberal democracy to natural reason. Thus, the reclassification of post-war 'religion’ played an important role in constructing and authorising the post-war secularity. It is this which constitutes the governing norms of contemporary Japan. Are There 'Religion’ and 'the Secular’ in Premodern Japan? Scholars working on premodern Japan tend to project 'religion’ and 'the secular’ upon the socio-cultural context they study. My contention is that there was no 'religion’ in premodern Japan. Therefore, there was no 'secularity’ in premodern Japan, either.  ",

For over two-millennia, the teachings and philosophies of Confucianism have shaped and influenced the moral attitudes and socio-political organisation of the Chinese people and other East Asian societies. Its contemporary revival has risen debates in academic circles on whether it is likely to reposition itself as a code or system of social ethics that could have a major impact in the region and consequently at a global scale. Modernised Confucian values can transform China’s existing state of affairs and become an intellectual and cultural resource to prompt a civil religion in the region with Confucian characteristics. This essay discusses the various dimensions of Confucianism in modern China and East Asia concluding that certain ethical, political, and philosophical components of the tradition—including some of its quasi-religious aspects—could be reconstructed and legitimately implemented as a dominant set of principles that can regulate institutions and mediate people’s behaviours. The constitution of a cultural civil religion is tied to morality, justice, and other precepts committed to social order, political stability, and righteous modes of governance.  ",

In a socio-historical context in which religious normativity and the privileging of religion have gone largely uncontested, it is increasingly evident that the previously suppressed voices of the non-religious is enjoying recognition, within a Post-1994 constitutional framework which strikes a delicate balance between the separation of religion from matters of State, on the one hand, and the accommodation of religion in the social life of the country on the other. In dialogue, primarily, with the bodies of works of Tala Asad and Charles Taylor, particularly Formations of the Secular and The Secular Age, respectively, this paper aims to explore the socio-legal and constitutional standing of South Africans who choose not to ascribe to any faith-based religious position. By contrasting the country’s jurisprudence legacy under Apartheid, against the development of specific case law within a new constitutional framework a set of arguments will be advanced to outline the new social contracts in support of the rights and obligations of the non-religious which were previously threatened and/or suppressed. Whilst this changed socio-legal and constitutional environment may make for a more positive outlook for non-religion and unbelief in South Africa it is also evident that, as opposed to the treatment that these crucial subjects have already received in the 'global north’ they remain largely academically unexplored in South Africa and Africa.

They are popular among part of population that might be characterized as „spiritual but not religious“ (Willard, Norenzayan 2017) – people who are not affiliated to traditional (Christian) church, and even have negative opinion about it, but who seek for different kind of spiritual experiences. As Willard and Norenzayan pointed out, „spiritual but not religious“ has „an experiential relationship to the supernatural, and see themselves more connected to the universe as a whole“. Although collective therapies are quite popular at the moment, scholars only partly focus on them. These therapies contain elements of rituals, dance, sharing narratives and personal experiences, and may be charged with different kind of emotions. Here, I will present data from my field (qualitative) research and, combining classical theories of ritual (Durkheim, Malinowski) with psychological theories, I will analyze 1) motives for searching for this kind of experience, 2) try to explain what function they may have and why is group important in this context and, 3) what is the role of emotions in this context. I will also focus on methodological issue and restrictions of qualitaive methods. ",

		"text": "Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in the Existence of God(s) Although many studies have examined predictors of belief and nonbelief in the existence of god(s), and many theories have surmised implicit reasons for individual differences in theistic beliefs, people’s subjective, explicit reasons for belief or nonbelief have different content. We studied these reasons in large surveys of U.S. adults (undergraduates and Internet-based samples). We examined reasons for nonbelief and belief: intellectual, relational, emotional (positive and negative), intuitive, experiential, socialization-based, and prior experiences with religion. Intellectual reasons predominated among nonbelievers; however, nonbelievers endorsed all reasons somewhat. These results contrasted with reasons for theistic belief, which distributed more equally across categories and averaged high levels of endorsement. Many reasons for nonbelief correlated with more ultimate meaning struggle and search for meaning, but only relational and agnostic reasons correlated with presence of meaning. These results highlight the diversity and importance of self-reported reasons behind people’s beliefs about the existence of God. Additional planned analyses will explore the potential for differences among self-described atheists, agnostics, the spiritual but not religious, and others who report no religious affiliation. No specific differences are anticipated, but any that result will be tested for replicability across multiple samples. This research will seek to explore the implications of nonreligious identities beyond their overt meanings regarding nonbelief in god(s). If reasons for nonbelief differ as well, this would lend further importance to these group identities, whereas null results would call their distinctiveness into question. ",

		"text": "Occupation, Generational Memory and 'Secular’ Self-Talk: the case of Generation Y Jewish-Israelis This paper sheds light on one aspect of the complex process whereby post-Oslo modalities of Occupation have been absorbed into self-narratives of one Jewish-Israeli social group: young hilonim ('secular Jews’) who came of age in the 2000s. Through a close reading of three interviews with young hilonim from across the political spectrum, it highlights one important but hitherto unappreciated aspect of collective generational memory which has primed their understanding of themselves as 'reasonable people.’ Using new fieldwork and survey data, it hypothesizes two things: first, that young hilonim have been susceptible to Likud-led governments’ strategies of legitimizing Occupation through what Van Leeuwen calls discursive 'rationalization;’ second, that hiloni habitus 'priming’ at a formative age has played some as-yet unappreciated role in this. The paper focuses on this 'priming’ process during the 2000s and 2010s. It discusses the case of hilonim in light of the comparative literature on 'secular Judaism,’ proposing a new theoretical approach for its study. Cultivating the reasonable hiloni self: a case of secular self-fashioning? As a contribution to debates on the emotional dimension of the secular, I look at practices of self-fashioning, particularly the cultivation and performance of the self as 'reasonable’. Using the case of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I argue that 'secular’ self-fashioning may sometimes have little to do with individuals engaging the secular-religious boundary in a particular society through processes of self-differentiation. I also argue that hiloni cultivation of reasonableness is an emotio-political outcome of a long-standing and unresolved ideological problem within Zionist thought. Reasonableness is not simply an emotional practice of self-cultivation but has also – indirectly and often unintentionally – facilitated and rendered opaque practices of Israeli state sovereignty over many aspects of Palestinian life. Secularity has facilitated sovereign governance of Palestinian social life but not through political secularism per se, which further illuminates the intersection between individual 'secular affect’ and state sovereignty. It’s not all about Islam: misreading secular politics in the Middle East In this post     discuss western secular politic habitus and it’s affect when intervening in, and understanding, recent uprisings in the Middle East and the rise of Islamic State. This post was originally published on Open Democracy 25 April 2015. A Different Kind of War Story: Afghan Atheism, Religious Freedom and the Mythology of Sanctuary The UK Home Office’s recent decision to grant asylum to a young Afghan man on the grounds of his atheism has been the subject of significant media interest and debate. In this blog post NSRN director     considers some of the wider cultural narratives contained within coverage of this case. . The political implications of non-religion and secularity in the Global North. As part of my research on the influences of secularity on the practice of warfare I am interested in how to trace the influence of political secularism and non-religiosity through the policy process. Though there are data on non-religiosity among the wider population, non-religiosity among policymakers has not yet been explored. My interviews with senior UK politicians, army officers and policymakers on radical Islamism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has featured some discussion of the personal religiosity and non-religiosity of these figures. I am interested in refining this further aspect of the interview process further. Christo-secular ambivalence in British security policy, 2001-2009 Although secularism has recently become a site of analysis for international politics, it has as yet received little theoretical elaboration in the area of security studies. A new research programme is needed to further this end, one that is not merely a secondary addendum to the existing one on religion and security. This paper suggests some directions for that research agenda, that turns to examine how trajectories of secularization and non-religion in Britain impacted on security policy towards radical Islam between 2001-2009. It seems that a kind of Christo-secular ambivalence has afflicted British security policy, both in the case of threat perception and the management of risk. The paper offers demonstrative examples from the Iraq War and counter-terrorism policy. ",

		"text": "The “Religious” and “Secular” Nature of Self-Spirituality: Insights from the Field In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR). Paul Heelas (1996) has deemed the emerging religio-cultural form underpinning this moniker, “selfspirituality,” as it sacralizes the self. Upon completing semi-structured interviews with twenty Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR conducted between 2014-2015, I found the discourse of self-spirituality to be informed by four core ethics: the ethic of self-responsibility, the ethic of authenticity, the ethic of productivity and the ethic of self-awareness (  2015). Drawing from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork conducted at three different sites in downtown Toronto—a Toastmaster’s meeting, a Twelve-Step group (Alcoholics Anonymous), and an evangelical church (C3)—I argue that the discourse of self-spirituality can be found, in strikingly similar forms, in each. In other words, despite the ostensible differences between these three organizations they, in fact, endorse quite similar conceptions of the self, as well as, respectively, preach a moral message of self-empowerment, which is tied to an expressive individualism. By presenting data derived from field notes and informal interviews, in tandem with formal documents produced by the organizations themselves, I aim to challenge the commonplace view that so-called religious spaces (i.e. evangelical churches), spiritual spaces (i.e. AA), and secular spaces (i.e. Toastmaster’s) are inherently different, as well as problematize the notion that emic categories such as “religious,” “not religious” and “spiritual but not religious” necessarily reflect vastly different conceptions of the self and the good life. Spirituality: Secular or Religious? In this post     questions whether the paradigm of secularization—exemplified by the recent work of Steve Bruce—is ultimately the most useful for studying spirituality. He contends that scholars might be better off eschewing essentialist definitions of “religion” and instead examining the various ways in which individuals operationalize the term “spirituality,” and for what purposes. Drawing from his qualitative research with Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR he argues that individuals who claim “spirituality” do so largely as a result of the religious imaginaries they hold. Thus investigating the nature of these imaginaries might prove far more fruitful than obsessing over whether or notspirituality is “real religion” or not. Émile Durkheim, the Sacred, and the Nonreligious In this post,     argues for a Durkheimian approach to nonreligion that focuses less on the labels “religion” and “nonreligion” and more on how the sacred manifests itself in contemporary life. “Of” or “For”: Studying “Spirituality” and the Problems therein… How might “spirituality” relate to “nonreligion”? In this blog post     reflects on this question with respect to the category of “spiritual but not religious.” Noting how a distinction between the study of spirituality and the study for spirituality is rarely made in the field of spirituality studies, he challenges scholars of spirituality to define their object more clearly and to declare their stakes in it.

		"text": "Reinterpreting sacred experiences: Examining how exposure to global and historical diversity can transform an individual's meaning system Experiences that are deemed spiritual or sacred often play an important role in both creating and sustaining religious beliefs but the way that these experiences are subsequently interpreted by individuals who have left religious worldviews is underexplored. This paper presents a case study that explores how an individual who previously experienced many vivid and powerful spiritual experiences came to question the ontological nature of those experiences and eventually reject his previous beliefs about them. Doing so involved the transformation of a deeply held meaning system and a radical change in self-identity, from charismatic-evangelical Christian to secular Humanist. A key element of this transformative process was exposure to accounts of similar experiences from other faiths and competing explanatory worldviews, both historical and contemporary. This exposure to other worldviews was an important part of transformation of his worldview. It is suggested that other important factors included his academic training in scientific method and critical thinking, positive personal relationships with people from contrasting cultures, and both a strong commitment to truth and a confidence in his own judgement that were the result of his prior faith and experiences. The confluence of particular intellectual, social and cultural influences led to the transformation of his beliefs and this personal context is critical to understanding the changes he experienced. This case demonstrates the importance of idiosyncratic details in the formation and transformation of worldviews and helps illuminate the complex relationship between globalisation and secularization.

		"text": "Mediating 'Religious’ and 'Non-Religious’ Spaces: A Cultural Expression of a Japanese Religion in Postwar France This paper will explore the roles that cultural representations can play in mediating the 'religious’ and 'non-religious’ spaces through the case of a Japanese religion operating in postwar France. Boundaries between religious and non-religious spaces are often contested and negotiated by relevant social actors and institutions, as evinced by recent scholarship on religions in the public sphere. Not much has been discussed so far, however, as to how representations and institutional activities associated with a certain culture can mediate the two spaces by translating the religious representations and messages into the cultural counterparts. To highlight this dynamic, this paper will highlight the case of a Japanese religion known as Tenrikyō as it operates in postwar France. Tenrikyō’s propagation in France is characterised by its two-tier yet legally separate institutional structure involving 'religious’ and 'cultural’ associations—an institutional demarcation necessitated by the French legal framework relating to the 1901 and 1905 laws. In the course of promoting cultural activities as a way to increase the visibility and legitimacy of the name Tenri in the French public, Tenrikyō has at times the reinterpretation process but is not a sufficient explanation for the radical used representations and activities associated with Japan in ways that allow messages and representations that are otherwise confined to religious spaces to go beyond the boundaries thereof. By exploring the case of Tenrikyō in France, this paper will consider the implications and limitations of using cultural resources to present a religious tradition in a non-religious space. Translating a 'Religion’, Translating a 'Culture’: A 'Non-Religious’ Expression of a Japanese Religion in France     presents an analysis of what he calls a 'non-religious’ expression of a Japanese religion that has been operating in France since the 1970s. He explores how the translation of a 'religious tradition’ into a 'culture’ has been perceived in the changing cultural and socio-political conditions in French society. ",

A particular cultural element has been recognized in the democratization literature, but the focal point of this study of 'culture' has not been change but persistence. With a methodology that brings together agency, time and social context, this study aims at grasping cultural change in, firstly what has been perceived on the field as a continuity (i.e. settled cultural processes), and secondly what has been consciously recognized as a process of change (i.e. unsettled cultural processes). Focusing on the interrelationship of these cultural processes, I problematize the polarization between secularism(s), Islamism(s) and their 'others’, which has arguably been the deepest ideological struggle behind the core questions of coexistence in the history of Turkey’s democratization. By analyzing a selection of conversational texts from three fields that signify a reproduction of intolerance—these fields are 'Alevis and funerals’, 'women and clothing’, and 'LGBT and show business’—I will argue that Turkey has recently faced some unprecedented questions of tolerance, which includes new approaches to the politics of recognition, difference and negative tolerance. In conclusion, the study will touch upon the ways to examine 'settled’ and 'unsettled’ cultural processes, the re-making of secularism in Turkey, and the differentiated meanings of the concept of tolerance in this period.

The term “atheism” is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Bantō, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603–1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Bantō denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Bantō, gods were a “skillful means” created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Bantō believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Bantō, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Bantō’s “no gods” argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Bantō is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Bantō will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of “atheism” and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought. ",

However, there were very few self-declared atheists, secularists, and humanists in Western history prior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even during the Modern period, there are not many. This is especially true in my own research of nineteenth and early twentieth-century France. Those who took the name of atheist such as Baron d’Holbach or Jacques-André Naigeon were exceptional militants. The quest to find other such atheists buried in the pages and hidden messages of key books is a limited endeavor. Atheism as a concept does not originate from any single creed or doctrine and is itself open to permutation. Looking for a clear and distinct form of atheism is looking for a conceptual phenomenon constructed by the researcher. The language and words we use control and direct how we understand the past. The term “atheist” imposes a rigidity to a fluid and shifting phenomenon. Instead, we should open up our research to the emergence of modern “unbelief,” as defined by Gordon Stein and Tom Flynn in The Encyclopedia of Unbelief. This paper will argue for “unbelief” as the proper analytical category as a field of future research that will allow for a much larger, more inclusive, variegated set of parameters to understand the rupture with traditional forms of religion or spiritual practices. The important change in intellectual history was not the emergence of a particular atheism that promoted scientism and which held to its positions dogmatically but the acute doubt of past intellectual and religious traditions that led to a spectrum of new ideologies and religious positions. Leaving the French Church, 1870-1940 In this article,     explains the importance of uncovering the previously ignored voices of French freethinkers and ex-clergy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This will,   suggests, help to shed light on a critical transitionary period in French history and on some of the wider factors contributing to secularization in France. ",

		"text": "Sovereign of Herself: Women’s Narratives of 'Lived Atheism’ In most western societies the number of female non-believers is growing and atheism has become one manifestation of nonreligion among many (Pew Forum, 2015). However, little is known about female atheists. This article fills the gap by providing the voices of a small percentage of women who consider themselves 'practising’ but not 'active’ atheists. Through a sociological analysis of qualitative interviews with twenty self-identified atheist women I argue for the importance of researching the mundane aspects of female atheism which often fall under the radar when scholars focus predominantly on the vocal and politically active atheists. 'Lived atheism’ comprises small and seemingly insignificant actions and utterances which structure atheist women’s lives and contribute to the creation of new worldviews, symbols, and reflexive strategies. Micro-actions triggered by religious content, symbols and utterances, found in the nominally secular fabric of everyday life, add up to novel forms of gendered agency which is markedly different to outspoken activist atheism, and yet not the same as agnosticism, pure indifference, or 'none-ism’. By examining 'atheist flashpoints’ – moments when dormant atheist convictions come to the surface – I demonstrate how women practice 'everyday atheism’ as they navigate personal and public spaces. Not for Girls? Gender and Researching Nonreligion In the latest contribution to the SSNB/NSRN Methods Blog,     explores how we need to structure our methodologies to take account of gender – and how our methodologies may themselves be structured by gender.

Through an ethnographic content analysis of 1,028 letters to the editor, I examine how authors frame the relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and religious faith. I find there are four ways of doing so: 1) implicit polarization, obliquely denies any compatibility between religion and evolution; 2) distancing, separates one’s position from that of another; 3) articulation, weaves evolution and faith together; and 4) combinations of polarization, distancing, and articulation. Each framing results in some mixture of stigmatization and validation of atheism, literalism, and non-literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes and validates atheism and literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes non-literalism through unacknowledgment. Distancing can validate and stigmatize literalism and non-literalism, while it also results in literalism and atheism being stigmatized by putative allies. Articulation validates non-literalism by representing it in the public sphere and it stigmatizes atheism and literalism through unacknowledgment. ",

		"text": "Activist Unbelief in Canadian History Canada has a long history of religious unbelief. This paper offers a social historical survey of its organized, activist forms. The radical thought of the Enlightenment was imported in the late eighteenth century, which saw Voltairean deists like Fleury Mesplet criticizing the Catholic Church in the French-speaking colony of Lower Canada. A long tradition of anticlericalism followed in Quebec even though (or because) the Church was massively influential. The rest of Canada saw freethought and rationalist movements, often organized by working-class autodidacts, developing in the nineteenth century with American and British influences. This tradition continued into the first half of the twentieth century when secularists grappled with fundamentalism and the challenge of radical politics. After World War II the language of secular humanism was deployed and organizations were run by highly educated professionals instead. The position of activist unbelief began to change as Canada shifted from being one of the Western world’s most religious countries to being one of the least in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unbelief became unremarkable, though the persistence of religion meant that the twenty-first century saw a revival of militant atheism. This survey shows that unbelief was never just a pure philosophical position but has always been shaped by the social status quo it evolved in or was opposing. Nor was opposition ever enough; activist unbelievers inevitably had to offer the undecided a vision of the secular world they were working towards, and this meant getting involved in some form of politics. God-blasters vs Philosophical Atheists: Real and Perceived Divisions Among Unbelievers     draws on the history of Canadian unbelief to argue that ideological labels should not overshadow the pragmatic way unbelievers of all stripes actually behaved when dealing with the broader society.

		"text": "Crossbreeding Atheism with Spirituality: Notes on Soviet and Western Attempts The recent “nonreligious turn” in studies of secularity has changed the focus from what secularity lacks in comparison to religion to what it offers as an alternative. Various forms of nonreligion have been studied extensively in recent years, yet mostly in the contemporary Western societies. This article shifts the context more to the east and also towards the history by comparing two instances when meaning-making gained a central position within an atheist tradition. For our first example, we examine the appeal to spirituality in the period of late Soviet atheism; the second comes from contemporary Western “atheist spirituality”. By studying the publications by relevant authors, the article explores what can be learned about atheism and spirituality from this comparison, how atheism and spirituality are understood and combined, and the reasons for the sudden emphasis on existential questions within an atheist tradition. On the Origin and Rise of Atheism Theism has probably been the most influential belief in human history. However, atheism/naturalism can be traced back to ancient schools like Epicureanism and Cˉarvˉaka (India) and during the last 300 years atheism has gradually become fairly general in some countries. What is the origin of atheism? Why is it increasing? Based on dual-process theory and recent research on atheism a theoretical 'holistic’ hypothesis can be made. According to dual-process theory processes of human mind can be divided into intuitive (automatic, rapid, nonverbal, evolutionary old) and reflective (controlled, slow, linked to language, evolutionary recent). In holistic hypothesis three levels of factors are taken into account in explaining atheism/theism. 1) Biological level. Especially two universally evolved intuitive human cognitive traits — hyperactive agency detection device (HADD) and theory of mind (ToM) — have helped mankind to survive but have also made theism attractive. This partially explains why gods and supernatural beliefs have dominated the human history. 2) Psychological level. Those who are more prone to reflective processing or have deficiency of ToM seem to have a tendency towards atheism. This in part explains why scepticism/atheism is an ancient and universal phenomenon. 3) Sociocultural level. Certain (mostly modern) factors – like general wealth, security, modern environment, freedom of belief, education, secularization, and public visibility of atheism and natural/scientific explanations – seem to decline people’s motivation for religion and/or incline minds into reflective processing. From the viewpoint of holistic hypothesis, both theism and atheism are 'natural’ stances. ",

		"text": "“A Swedish Voltaire” The Life and Afterlife of Ingemar Hedenius, 20th-Century Atheist Ingemar Hedenius (1908–1982) was a professor of philosophy, and one of Sweden’s most famous public intellectuals in the decades following the Second World War. This was primarily due to his 1949 work Tro och vetande (English: Belief and Knowledge) in which he criticized religion, and his subsequent activity in the promotion of atheism and criticism of the relationship between church and state. This article engages with Hedenius’s life and works, but has a particular focus on his “afterlife”. The article utilizes theories of cultural memory to examine how Hedenius has been remembered since his death. I argue that Hedenius and his Tro och vetande in Sweden have taken the role of a node, or inescapable orientation point, of discussions of atheism, belief and knowledge, and the validity of Christian truths. Hedenius’s memory continues to loom large over religion and nonreligion in Sweden to this day. The material used as primary sources in this article include scholarly works of philosophy, theology and history, by renowned Swedish academics, but it also contains interpretations of Hedenius in the wider public debate, not least as expressed by the Swedish Humanist Association, who regard him as a main inspiration for their activities.

		"text": "What is Nonreligion? On the Virtues of a Meaning Systems Framework for Studying Nonreligious and Religious Worldviews in the Context of Everyday Life Discussions of nonreligion or secularity face a central challenge that has long plagued scholars of religion – that of specifying an object of study. Although several suggestions have been made, I think we can most effectively capture the range of things we want to study by (1) adopting worldviews, defined in terms of “big questions,” as an overarching rubric that encompasses both religious and nonreligious outlooks and (2) nuancing our understanding of worldviews in light of the meaning systems (MS) framework, already in use in psychology. Doing so relieves scholars of the obligation of defining religion and nonreligion and allows us to focus on how individuals and groups characterize themselves. It provides a neutral starting point for analyzing worldviews that is not biased toward religion, and, in so far as a case can be made that all humans must address these questions at least implicitly, it offers a basis for comparison across cultures. The so-called “existentially indifferent” provide a challenge in this regard and allow us to consider the value of an evolutionary perspective on meaning making.

Utilizing an intersectional lens, I conclude that lessons of the Christian home, reinforced in religious school and at church, drew a connection between Christianity, one’s racial and ethnic identity, and heterosexuality in such a way that being LGBTQ was marked un-Christian and foreign, and sometimes associated with whiteness. This further shaped how my participants navigated the urban public sphere, one of the only spheres where they could 'be LGBTQ’ – some neighborhoods were constructed as Christian, connected to one’s childhood and hostile to LGBTQ people, while others were LGBTQ-friendly, albeit largely white and gentrified. The overall impact of Christianity across multiple spheres influenced which non-religious paths my participants took. One remained with a Christian denomination of her childhood and one remained with a Christian denomination of her mother but not her father. The other eight left Christianity behind, with one choosing a different religion and seven becoming non-religious, holding identities from Unitarian Universalist to atheist. Overall, black LGBTQ people struggle to find acceptance of their LGBTQ identities by people closest to them and acceptance of their racial, ethnic and non-religious identities in largely white and often non-religious LGBTQ spaces. In response, they use different strategies to find community and live coherent lives, whenever possible. ",

		"text": "Organized Secularism in the United States: New Directions in Research There has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of the US population that is not religious. However, there is, to date, very little research on the social movement that is organizing to serve the needs of and advocate for the nonreligious in the US. This is a book about the rise and structure of organized secularism in the United States. By organized secularism we mean the efforts of nonreligious individuals to build institutions, networks, and ultimately a movement that serves their interests in a predominantly religious society. Researchers from various fields address questions such as: What secularist organizations exist? Who are the members of these organizations? What kinds of organizations do they create? What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past? And what is their likely impact on the future of secularism? For anyone trying to understand the rise of the nonreligious in the US, this book will provide valuable insights into organized efforts to normalize their worldview and advocate for their equal treatment in society. What Happens in Vegas is... Moral Embattlement: Irreligious Moral Performance as Cultural Resistance in Sin City Labeling atheists as immoral individuals, the very personification of evil, is not a particularly new idea. Attaining civic inclusion in a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, a city like Las Vegas where God is believed to be absent, would be easy. This is simply not the case. The strong cultural lore of “Sin City” promotes a false illusion that Las Vegas is a city where vice trumps virtue for sinners rather than saints. In this paper, I take a qualitative ethnographic approach that integrates participant observation, visual data, and in-depth interviews with textual analysis of local news stories. My goal is to understand how atheists have engaged in community building, activism, and collective boundary work in Las Vegas. My findings suggest that the moral landscape of Las Vegas very much a terrain of resistance where the interplay between religious and secular ideologies create a contested web of power and counter-power relations, indicating that even in Las Vegas where it is acceptable to be a sinner, heathens are persona non grata. I argue that the mobilization of collective action among the Las Vegas humanists and atheists community should be understood as dramaturgical performances of irreligious morality that both justifies the rejection of deviant labels and challenges the moral proclivity of American theists. The implications of these findings center on larger issues concerning atheist visibility, which I contend is a cultural expression of resistance, not only in “Sin City”, but in the United States as a whole ",

		"text": "No One Expects a Transgender Jew: Religious, Sexual and Gendered Intersections in the Evaluation of Religious and Nonreligious Others While a large body of research has established that there is substantial prejudice against atheists and nonreligious individuals, both in the US and in other countries where nonreligious people are minorities, to date very little research has looked beyond attitudes toward solitary identities (e.g., “atheists” vs. “gay atheists”). Given the growing recognition of the importance of intersectionality in understanding the experiences of minorities, in this article we examined attitudes toward intersected identities, combining five (non)religious identities (i.e., Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, and nonreligious) with four sexual/gender identities (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender) using a 100-point thermometer scale (N = 618). We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were religious identities, with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non)religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” religious identities, unless those religious identities are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious. Health Disparities in Nonreligious and Religious Older Adults in the United States: A Descriptive Epidemiology of 16 Common Chronic Conditions In this paper, we compute prevalence estimates for nonreligious and religious people in relation to 16 common chronic conditions in contemporary American society. Using survey data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we speak to current debates concerning potential relationships between religion, nonreligion and health in older adult populations with two key findings. First, we show no consistent relationships between religion or nonreligion and chronic condition prevalence. Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i.e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing intersectional approaches to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health. “They Just Don’t Stand for Nothing”: LGBT Christians’ Definitions of Non-Religious Others In this exploratory study, I examine how a group of LGBT Christians conceptualized non-religious others. Based on over 450 hours of fieldwork in an LGBT Christian church located in the southeastern region of the United States, I demonstrate how a group of LGBT Christians defined non-religious others as (1) morally suspect and untrustworthy, (2) in need of salvation and guidance, and (3) poor representations of the LGBT community. Although these LGBT Christians used “non-religious” as a catchall term without ever specifying exactly who it captured, they used the first two definitions to apply to non-religious people in general regardless of sexuality while explicitly focusing on non-religious sexual minorities in their third definition. Moreover, I show how these definitions echoed mainstream religious rhetoric in America used to marginalize both sexual and religious minorities. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how religious depictions of non-religious people may reproduce societal patterns of inequality; and (2) the importance of analyzing how religious people define and interpret non-religious others.

		"text": "Science and religion conflict for non-religious Britons and Canadians     introduces new project findings from social scientific research conducted in Canada and the UK. She highlights the tendency of non-religious publics and life scientists in both countries to see science and religion as conflicting. Espousing Apostasy and Feminism? Older and Younger British Female Apostates Compared It has been acknowledged that white western men are more likely to leave their former religion behind (Altemeyer and Hunsberger, 1997, Zuckerman, 2012), or declare themselves of no religion (Brown and Lynch, 2012, Baker and Smith, 2009), than women (Beit-Hallahmi, 2007). But it has not been unknown for women, even in the past, both of the older and younger generations to do the same (Budd 1977; Schwarz 2010). This article, based on two small scale studies in the United Kingdom, considers a group of older and a group of younger women 'apostates’, to determine what leads them to do this and examines whether developing a feminist orientation plays a role. Religious women in second wave feminism were often ignored, having been considered to have chosen patriarchy over feminism while there is some evidence that women with feminist attitudes are less likely to be religious (Redfern and Aune, 2013, 154, Furseth, 2010, 210). Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis to determine overarching themes, while the three-fold typology of apostasy developed by Zuckerman (2012) allowed the authors to examine similarities and differences between older and younger women who choose to leave religion behind. They conclude reasons for apostasy are various, certainly not solely attributable to developing a feminist orientation. . The Young Atheists: investigating secularism today amongst young Britons | Swiss charitable foundation the Jacobs Foundation is funding this one year small scale and qualtiative project employing the methods of semi-structured interviewing and participant observation in order to investigate British young people‟s participation with secularist organisations such as the National Secular Society and the British Humanist Association, which run activities specifically for young people. It aims to address the area of young people and secularism, providing original data on young people‟s experiences and perceptions of non-religion (secularism, atheism, humanism etc) and religion and how they think their secularist participation relates to their wider lives. The project has developed out of the Foundation‟s 2010 conference “The role of values and religion in youth development. A culture-informed perspective”, at which the absence of such data was bemoaned by scholars including José Casanova and Grace Davie. Ideas and advice on how to proceed is sought, especially as this is a relatively new area of research for both the project‟s PI (   ) and RA (   ) ",

		"text": "The 'Nones’ and the Australian Census In the await for the Australian Census result coming out in mid-2017,     reflects on demographics of Australian 'nones’ from 1971 to date. He demonstrates that inconsistency and complexity of the question of 'nones’ result in confusion over how to best describe these people and interpret their expression of unbelief, anticipating the upcoming Census report will bring us new insights. Nonreligion and Religious Pluralism in Australia: A New Context for Christian Identity and Dialogue By all indicators, Australia is among the most nonreligious nations on earth, rated 10th by the WIN-Gallup 2012 Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. In this paper I will firstly outline religious/nonreligious identification in Australia on the basis of the 2011 national census data. A comparison with earlier data shows a steady decrease in identification with Christian churches other than Roman Catholicism, a small but steady increase in identification with religions other than Christianity, and a consistent increase in the number of Australians identifying as 'no religion’ (22.5% in 2011). In the second section of the paper, I will look beyond the statistics of institutional identification to explore social research into the beliefs and practices Australians use to make sense of life. This perspective calls for a more nuanced description of religious/nonreligious identity than data such as a national census can provide. In the Australian context, as well as intentional religious and nonreligious identification we find evidence of high levels of both 'believing without belonging’ and 'belonging without believing’, within a pragmatic cultural attitude of 'practical secularity’. This situation is reminiscent of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s analysis of his own 1940s European context, a 15 post-Christendom culture in which people lived and acted 'as though God does not exist’. In the third section of the paper, I will draw on Bonhoeffer’s challenging insights about what the Christian church can learn from the 'promising godlessness’ of its contemporaries to propose some characteristics of the kind of dialogue Christians are called to in Australia’s pluralistic context.

I plea for collecting and analyzing manifestations of the secular, as the secular as an phenomenon in society is surprisingly unexplored. To stimulate such inquiry, I suggest a material approach to the secular, as it will provide researchers with tools to conduct empirical research on the secular in contemporary societies. Inspired by Joan Scott, Charles Hirschkind, and Talal Asad, this article explores the notion of a Dutch 'sexular’ body: a body which affective-gestural repertoires, limited here to the context of sexuality, people in society (historically) associate with the secular. I conclude by arguing that a material approach to the secular will contribute to (1) obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the secular, including its cultural conceptualizations and manifestations, and (2) clarifying, and hence facing the normativity the secular imposes on the people living in secular societies.

		"text": "Institutional Confidence in the United States: Attitudes of Secular Americans The First Amendment to the United States’ Constitution addresses freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995–2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions. Based on previous literature and the empirical evidence presented in this study, we argue that overall lower levels of institutional confidence among secular Americans is an outcome of the exclusion of such individuals from American social life. Thus, it highlights the importance of addressing the stereotypes and prejudice that this minority group faces. Belonging without Believing: Secular Functions of Churches in Northern Europe Levels of religious beliefs, practices, and identification are at the center of the current debate on European secularization. Grace Davie (e.g. 1990; 2002) argues that Europeans believe without belonging, referring to high levels of individualized understandings of the supernatural, while active participation is low. In contrast, I argue that attendance alone offers a limited understanding of religious belonging, and that many Northern Europeans, particularly Scandinavians, belong without believing, in that they support and indentify with latent, secular functions of churches while they no longer believe. This study uses a mixedmethods approach comprised of in-depth interviews as well as quantitative data from the International Social Survey Program and the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey. While figures of religious belief and belonging are frequently presented in the literature, few explain and highlight such findings with qualitative data. Scotland and Sweden were chosen as two comparative case studies from the relatively secularized Northern Europe. Findings reveal that a majority of Swedes are culturally religious (e.g. Zuckerman, 2008) as they do not believe but still identify with the Church of Sweden, which serves a largely secular purpose as part of a cultural heritage and as a provider of life cycle ceremonies. In Scotland, on the other hand, belonging without believing is more closely associated with a sense of community or cultural defense (e.g. Bruce, 2002) in a nation that is more religiously diverse. The findings ultimately draw attention to the importance of context and conceptualization in the study of distinct and multidimensional processes of secularization. ",

Looking for a 'God-Shaped Hole’: The Political Dimensions of Religiosity and Anti-Atheist Attitudes The current literature on negative attitudes towards atheists reports many Americans carry cultural prejudice, seeing them as immoral, cynical, and hedonistic, and that individuals with high levels of religiosity are more likely to hold these kinds of biases. That story may be too simple, though, because we do not know what kinds of religiosity are associated with these attitudes. Existing literature on the topic often mixes indicators of distinct religious constructs or narrowly chooses indicators of only one type of religiosity. Using a combination of structural equation and ordered logit modeling with 2014 survey data from The American Mosaic Project, this paper demonstrates that high religious centrality—a personal identity favoring the integration of faith with other roles in public life—is distinctly and significantly associated with both public and private distrust of atheists unlike other forms of frequent religious participation or high religious orthodoxy. This centrality also has a strong Christian component and is explicitly political. It is expressed in relationships among survey questions probing respondents’ personal religiosity and their expectation that good citizens and competent leaders will be both Christian and religious, respectively. Substantively, these results lend support for a theoretical account of citizenship which incorporates a critical approach to studying dominant cultural forms of religiosity in the United States. They also suggest that it is methodologically prudent to carefully distinguish respondents’ constructs of religiosity when attempting to explain negative attitudes towards religious and non-religious minority groups.

		"text": "Ancestor Worship amongst Today’s Unbelievers Nonreligious people often experience, and revere, the presence of their deceased relatives. Typically described as 'religious experience’, the uniqueness of unbelievers’ experiences of the dead are widely misunderstood. In this year’s Nonreligion & Secularity Research Network’s annual lecture Professor     (Goldsmiths, University of London) discusses new research into the 'ancestor worship’ of British unbelievers, and asks – what do these experiences tell us about unbelief, nonreligion and the richness of human experience? Creating Data about Nonreligious Belief     is a leading sociologist of 'belief’. Here, she sets out what working with 'belief’ as a significant category of self-understanding can achieve, for religious 'unbelievers’ as much as for 'believers’. She encourages the use of analytical tools that respond to the complexity and multidimensionality of belief, and introduces her own seven-point method as one such approach. . Comparing Belief Cross-Culturally: An Organic, Holistic Model | Research about religion and belief often imposes definitions that limit out understanding and sometimes skew findings to represent supposedly religious orientations. We need an interpretive method to allow us to analyse cross-culturally and compare what belief means to different people in different places at different times. Analysing belief holistically and organically helped me to resolve the 'census question' puzzle: why would so many non-religious people choose to claim a Christian identity on the UK census? Applying that analytical framework helped me identify two prominent belief orientations: anthropocentric and theocentric. I will summarise briefly here what I mean by those „orientations‟. 'Believing in belonging': Researching belief without asking religious questions A unique research method was designed to answer the question: 'What do people believe in nowadays and how do we find out?' This approach was the first in the sociology of Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives religion to research belief by asking non-religious questions of apparently non-religious people. My qualitative method, detailed here, produced data that led me to conclude that statements of religious affiliation are often expressions of 'believing in belonging', where people associate with religion to reinforce ethnic, familial, or other social identities.

		"text": "Methodological challenges in conducting research on irreligious Tunisians This presentation will examine the methodological difficulties related to the study of the nonreligion phenomenon within Tunisia (a Muslim-majority country). I argue that the problem stems from the difficulty of defining and locating nonreligion, especially in the absence of any forms of organization. Certain material manifestations of nonreligion can be signs of unorthodox Islam rather than material signs of nonreligion ,while abidance by some Islamic rituals is not necessarily a sign of piety and belief. I propose the neologism 'practicing irreligious Tunisians’ to refer to irreligious individuals who consciously choose to continue performing Islamic rituals. Abiding by certain Islamic rituals has become for these irreligious Tunisians living with traditional Muslim families, a manner to develop more empathy, by refusing to inflict pain on their beloved ones. This moral consideration is shaped by what these irreligious Tunisians refer to as 'humane values’ or in a more ironic manner ' ethics of Kofar’2 . The methodological challenge resides in distinguising between unorthodoxy and nonreligion .Who is a real irreligious Tunisian ? To understand the subversive nature of the irreligious performance of Islamic rituals , I rely on the virtual sphere which presents an outlet used by many irreligious Tunisians to express their 'authentic selves’. I combine both virtual ethnography and long-term relationships with irreligious Tunisians to explore nonreligion in a context where the fear of social rejection and the ambivalence of the legal system vis-à-vis nonreligious Tunisians make it difficult to openly approach the subject in the public sphere.

		"text": "Honest Answers to Awkward Questions In this installment of the SSNB/NSRN Methods Blog series, psychologist     introduces us to the unmatched count technique for survey research.  This technique is designed to allow survey takers to give more honest answers to awkward questions (e.g. Do you believe in God?) and to allow researchers to make more accurate population level estimates of socially sensitive phenomena (e.g.  the prevalence of atheism).  The Roots of Right and Wrong: Do Concepts of Innate Morality Reduce Intuitive Associations of Immorality With Atheism? Atheists are frequent targets of prejudice and discrimination. Previous research suggests that anti-atheist prejudice may stem in part from perceptions of religion as an ultimate basis for morality: without God, why do good (or not do bad)? We conducted two studies to test whether presenting recent scientific findings regarding the nonreligious bases of morality (e.g., morality in nonhuman primates and preverbal infants) might lead people to view morality as innate, thus reducing intuitive associations of immorality and atheism. Consistent with previous research, participants viewed moral transgressions as more representative of atheists than of Christians. However, learning about the putatively innate nature of morality did not lead participants to view immorality as less representative of atheists. Intuitive moral distrust of atheists appears quite resilient, persisting even in the face of evidence for the nonreligious origins of morality. ",

		"text": "The Varieties of Personal Orientations to Religion: Dynamics of Religious and Nonreligious Positions in Self-Narratives of Well-Educated Young Adults in the Netherlands Self-narratives are well-known resources from which to analyze the subtleties of people’s orientations toward “religion“. They provide the necessary biographical context for addressing individual religiousness in the context of personal concerns, experiences and orientations, thus stressing the diversity and varieties of people’s religious orientations and experiences which are embedded in processes of interpretation and reflection related to activities and events in daily life, and evolving and changing in the course of a lifetime. “Religious” or “nonreligious” people are often not only addressing, adopting, or contesting various contents of belief in plural religious contexts, but also demonstrating various “modes of belief or unbelief ” such as being convinced, trusting, hoping, assuming, preferring, doubting, pondering, denying etc. When we consider these varieties, clear-cut distinctions between “being religious” and “being nonreligious” will often disappear. The main research question in our current project is: What types of religiousness are discernable among well-educated adults in the Netherlands ? We started our empirical research with a preliminary exploratory study which is still ongoing. Until yet 20 selfnarratives (gained by a combination of biographical-narrative interviews with semi-structured interviews) of students at polytechnic institutes of higher learning in the Netherlands have been gathered. The purposive sample aims at maximal variation among self-ascribed religiousness, spirituality, nonreligiousness and non-spirituality. Thus far Catholics and former Catholics, Protestants and former Protestants, Muslims, people affiliated with the socalled holistic milieu and people with no religious affiliation or interest in spirituality at all have been included into the sample. Besides different constellations of religiousness, nonreligiousness, spirituality and “non-spirituality”, a thematic coding analysis of the 20 interviewtranscripts also revealed two common patterns in the interviews thus far: a moral orientation to life and variations of a just-world belief (Lerner, 1980). This paper will elaborate on the different constellations and on the common patterns as well. Conceptual and methodological consequences for a psychological study of “nonreligiousness” will be discussed. ",

In my on-going qualitative research on self-identified atheists in contemporary Turkey, I aim to investigate atheists’ perceptions on relations between politics and religion, as well as to understand how this relationship affects atheists’ personal experiences in society. As a part of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with atheists from different backgrounds in Turkey. In these interviews, atheists based their perspectives on personal experiences and did not strictly differentiate between religious and nonreligious. The informants often perceived current politics and religion as closely linked to each other and underlined an increasing religiosity and polarization in society drawing on examples related to media, gender, politics and education. While there were significant differences between opinions of atheists from religious and secular families, almost all the informants regarded religion as an expansionist power that is becoming more visible in every area of social life with the policies imposed by the current right-wing government. They recommended limiting religion to the private sphere and thus creating secular spaces in which not only religious Muslims but everyone could thrive. ",

		"text": "Grassroots Atheism and the Atheist Movement In this research we examine research done on the (at the time) unmoderated and hugely popular online atheist forum – reddit.com/r/atheism – in relation to the ideology new atheism and the atheist movement in North America. The study on /r/atheism was a qualitative study conducted in early 2013, which traced discursive practices on an online space with no official ties to atheist or humanist organizations. The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the 'practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory. Our cooperation has thus impelled us to ask questions regarding the use and construction of atheism in our respective work, as well as questions on which scientific research inform our different choices, and how this is reflected in the write up process. Atheists are Believers     asserts that atheism is not simply the negation or absence of religion but that it involves a complex array of epistemological, ethical and political beliefs. ",

Some respondents asserted that the term spiritual was so vague as to be almost useless. They preferred terms such as emotional connectedness, awe, or beauty, which are commonly included in definitions of spirituality. For a few individuals, spirituality referred to the existence of spirits. A minority in the study (12%) had what might be defined as 'other worldly experiences,’ although these were explained in purely naturalistic terms (e.g., lack of sleep, drugs/alcohol, and brain dysfunction).

		"text": "Being areligious in Antiquity – Individual Dimensions of Disbelief Studies on Antiquity are mostly stuck in their dependence on literary sources. Philosophical, antiquarian, judicial or theological reflections, tragic, satirical, polemical or apologetic texts were mostly produced by 'organizational men' (Jörg Rüpke). They set the agenda of proper behaviour, norms and practices and, what they consider to be deviant. They create the dichotomy of 'religion' and 'atheism'. „Battling the Gods. Atheism in the Ancient World“ (2015) by Tim Whitmarsh is just the latest example of how difficult it is for scholars to look beyond these dominating discourses. The project I am thinking about aims at individual aspects of disbelief and personal reasons for denying to participate in rituals and cults or merely being indifferent towards 'religion'. So far my approach is informed by the 'Lived Ancient Religion' concept of the ERC funded Research Group at the Max Weber Kolleg Erfurt and the theoretical framework of the 'Multiple Secularities' project at the University of Leipzig. The biggest methodological challenge will be the quest for sources and testimonies, since there are no ego-documents of 'confessing' sceptics or atheists. One has to analyze indirect sources as, for example, leges sacrae and will meet a lot of difficulties to distinguish wilful disregard from unintentional transgression etc. Nonetheless, in my point of view, it is about time to conceptualize these individual dimensions of non-religion for the ancient world (namely in the time and space of the Roman Empire) and ask about the dynamics it set free in groups responses.

		"text": "Contested Secularism(s) in Bangladesh Secularism and the role of religion in the public sphere in Bangladesh have been highly contested issues in Bangladesh since a long period, but contestation and polarization have regained remarkable intensity in the recent past. In this context also the academic writing on the issue of secularism, national identity and religion in Bangladesh and concomitant conflicts has remerged with new impetus. In this presentation I will explore the light that recent academic writing sheds on contested secularism in Bangladesh. I will summarize the existing literature by pointing to different narratives and motives frequently presented in the literature. This will help us to understand how these contestations around religion and secularism in Bangladesh are commonly interpreted and how various issues and conflicts are conflated within these debates. As a second step, I will discuss to which extend the scholarly works can themselves be considered as part of politics around the contested issue of “secularism” and the role of religion in Bangladesh. Therefore, I will summarize which implicit or explicit claims or political statements are made by the authors, and in which ways these statements relate to the positions of respective authors as well as academia in general. Further, I would like to contrast the academic discourse concerning issues related to secularism in Bangladesh to the emerging scholarship that discusses ways of conceptualizing non-religion and secularism. Consequently, I will use a few selected approaches to argue that a conversation between both so far largely disconnected corpuses of scholarship can be of mutual benefit as it allows a critical review of the existing narratives and debates in both of them. I will conclude my presentation with proposing possible approaches that will allow us a deeper understanding of the politics of secularism in Bangladesh.  ",

How Christian Atheists Can Shed Light on Anti-Atheist Prejudice in America Anti-atheist prejudice in the United States is well documented in both academic studies and in news media yet its underlying causes are still not fully known. Since data suggests that atheists experience prejudice in different ways and for different reasons than other more prominent types of discrimination, such as racial prejudice, the process of understanding anti-atheist prejudice likely requires unique research and critical thinking. In this essay, I will explore possible explanations for anti-atheist prejudice based on the most comprehensive scientific examinations of atheists as well as propose that social scientists study Christian atheists, people who lack a belief in God but subscribe to the moral teachings of Jesus, to see if they experience the same degree of prejudice and stereotyping as other atheists. While sociological data indicates that much of the negative stereotyping surrounding atheism results from concerns about an atheist’s ability to behave morally, it is not clear precisely what causes this moral distrust since atheists tend to not only lack a belief in any supernatural moral scorekeeper, but also any universal and codified set of ethical norms such as those found in religious texts. Since Christian atheists affirm the set of ethical norms of Christianity while lacking a belief in God, it would be highly useful to investigate whether people hold the same stereotypical view of them as they do atheists who do not self-identity as Christian atheists. Investigating the Social Cost of Atheism in the US     discusses the findings of a recent U.S. study which examined how perceived religiosity might influence appraisals of moral behaviour, considers the possible social consequences for nonreligious people, and suggests avenues for future research on this topic.

Self-identification as atheist is used as an indicator for non-religiousness with a high belief certainty. The social norm of non-religiosity is indicated by the national level of individuals identifying as not religious or atheist and the level of societal development is indicated by the level of a population’s health, education, and standard of living. The World Values Survey is used as data source for a quantitative intercultural comparison across 31 countries (N=49,611). Results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average more satisfied with life than atheist and non-religious individuals when only including individual-level variables in the analysis, but that they do not differ in their average level of life satisfaction when interactions with the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development are considered. Additionally, the difference between atheist and religious individuals’ life satisfaction decreases with higher levels of non-religiosity in society. It will be discussed why these results challenge the assumption of religiosity being related to a general advantage concerning individuals’ well-being. ",

Much has been made about the works of New Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, but relatively little has been done to analyze how they are consumed and reproduced, interpreted and critiqued, by everyday atheists. I address the tension between contemporary atheists’ skepticism regarding traditional authority and their simultaneous acceptance of some modes and sources of authority. Atheists themselves are aware of this tension, and treat it thoughtfully, playfully, and self-reflexively (jokingly calling Dawkins, for example, the Atheist Pope). I also connect my observations about authority in contemporary atheism with a commentary about gender in today’s atheist network, a subject for which my cultural sources provide rich material. This paper draws from cultural studies, religious studies, media studies, and gender studies in an effort to better understand how atheists builds narratives, community, and culture in deeply complex relationship with their understandings of religion, and not simply in reaction or opposition to religion.

		"text": "British Ex-Muslims: Constructing and negotiating the 'essential and revolutionary' The phenomenon of people leaving their religion is a common feature of many post-Christian Western societies. However, the investigation of the phenomenon of apostasy has mainly been restricted to Christian apostates. Apostasy in minority communities, specifically the Muslim community, is not well understood. This study investigates the why and the how of the construction of the 'Ex-Muslim' identity, defined as atheists and agnostics who have left Islam. A small-scale study with a qualitative, grounded theory approach within a social constructivism paradigm was used to explore the construction of the Ex-Muslim identity, and how Ex-Muslims managed and negotiated the stigma attached to their identity. Ten semistructured interviews and one focus group (five participants) were conducted to investigate why participants chose to call themselves 'Ex-Muslims' and what the consequences of embracing this identity were. Results revealed two dimensions to understand this identity. The first category conceptualises the stigmatisation from Muslim and the non-Muslim society, and a displacement of the self, lack of parental acceptance and gendered experiences as the defining factors in the realities of Ex-Muslims. The second category showed the strategies used to navigate the Ex-Muslim identity, consisting of a complex set of performance acts to manage social interactions as well as the construction of an Ex-Muslim community. The results show that the conditions of stigmatisation of apostasy can stimulate the displacement of the self, resulting into an evolving Ex-Muslim identity. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of negotiation of identities through performances (Goffman, 1963) as well as the concept of the 'ex' role identity (Ebaugh, 1988). ",

		"text": "Early-Modern Irreligion and Theological Analogy: A Response to Gavin Hyman’s A Short History of Atheism Historically, many Christians have understood God’s transcendence to imply God’s properties categorically differ from any created properties. For multiple historical figures, a problem arose for religious language: how can one talk of God at all if none of our predicates apply to God? What are we to make of creeds and Biblical passages that seem to predicate creaturely properties, such as goodness and wisdom, of God? Thomas Aquinas offered a solution: God is to be spoken of only through analogy (the doctrine of analogy). Gavin Hyman argues Aquinas’s doctrine of analogy was neglected prior to the early-modern period and the neglect of analogy produced the conception of a god vulnerable to atheistic arguments. Contra Hyman, in this paper, I show early-modern atheism arose in a theological context in which there was an active debate concerning analogy. Peter Browne (1665–1735) and William King (1650–1729) offered two competing conceptions of analogical predication that were debated through the 19th century, with interlocutors such as the freethinker Anthony Collins (1676–1729), theologian/philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and skeptic David Hume (1711–1776). Lastly, I discuss the 18th century debate over theological analogy as part of the background relevant to understanding Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. ",

		"text": "Making implicit nonreligious attitudes visible: secular criticism of religion and spirituality within societal institutions The study of nonreligion is, besides analyses of state secularism, very often concerned with nonreligious persons in the minority position, who are themselves perceived as contestations to religious world-views. For the opposite case, i.e. secular societies where nonreligious world-views are also dominant, Charles Taylor and José Casanova (2011) stated, that the latter would have the tendency to “naturalize” and thus become unconsciously held attitudes. Since what is taken for granted is rarely mentioned explicitly as well as there is by no means a canonized set of nonreligious beliefs collectively shared, those are difficult investigate beyond visible conflicts provoked by either religious groups or by perceived transgressions of taken-for-granted secular realms. Contestations and resulting negotiations may constitute a chance for the researcher (Knott 2007) to investigate 'naturalized’ assumptions, when it is explicated in order to explain the criticism groups, beliefs or practices. While it has shown that collective actors, groups, are more likely to be differentiated from the “in-group” through evoking a secular collective identity, subtle punctual transgressions of boundaries may reveals details about more diffused nonreligious – and implicit – attitudes and opinions. In this paper I will analyse examples for the latter case, precisely a sample of criticism(s) expressed in German online-newspapers towards perceived transgressions of legitimate (often medical) science by religio-spiritual world-views. Testing Taylor’s and Casanova’s claim in this practical area, the pivotal questions are 'what is precisely perceived as challenge and how is it characterized’? What is, on the other hand, perceived to be in need of protection, what are the feared dangers? What singular arguments and values are explicated in that defence? The findings from the material shall be discussed concerning their significance and surplus value for the study of nonreligion. ",

		"text": "Interpreting Active Forms of Atheism and Secularism as a Social Movement In the wake of so-called „New Atheism“, especially organized forms of nonreligion, atheism, and/or secularism have attracted an unprecedented degree of scholarly attention (see e.g. Cimino and Smith 2014, LeDrew 2016). These studies, mostly on the North American spectrum of atheist, humanist, and secularist organizations, have treated their subject, quite matter-of-factly, as a social movement. In my presentation, I would like to apply theoretical insight from the sociology of social movements to the study of nonreligion and secularity – more specifically to atheist, humanist, and secularist activism in the United States and Germany. On the one hand, I would like to analyze systematically in how far the field of organized and non-organized atheism, humanism, and secularism meets definitions of a social movement and in how far it can justifiably be called that. Most definitions of social movements place emphasis on the existence of formal and informal networks of collective and individual actors, a shared identity, a battle against political or cultural enemies, and the use of non-institutionalized means. So, on the other hand, I am going to portray the formal and informal networks in this field as well as recent dynamics and divergencies with respect to identity, opponents, and strategy using theories of collective action and collective identity. The aim of my paper, therefore, is both theoretical as well as descriptive: bringing theory from the sociology of social movements to fruition in the context of a new subject matter and broadening the empirical treatment of that subject matter to a European case. Organized Atheism in the US and Abroad – A Typology of Members from the Freethought-Secularist Movement With this paper, I would like to present the main results from my research on members of atheist or secularist organizations in the United States and Germany. In a situation in which religious indifference and strict religiosity were shown to be growing simultaneously in the modern world, yet the phenomenon of convinced irreligion was largely ignored, I set out several years ago to answer the question: Who are the decided, committed, and organized atheists and what drives their activism in different socio-religious settings within Western societies? This research was completed in late 2013. The results are based on 58 qualitative in-depth interviews with members from local atheist organizations, which offer their members community as well as chances for participation in political activism and which are conceptualized as part of a broader freethoughtsecularist movement. Despite their highly diverse religious / nonreligious backgrounds and biographies, processes of joining, and strategies and degrees of activism, eight distinctive types of members were identified. These are based on recurring narrative and action patterns (“motives”). The motive of political conflict unites the “Political Fighter” and the “Indignant”, the motive of belonging unites the “Collectivist” and the “Alienated”, the motive 16 of philosophical and religious knowledge unites the “Intellectual Enlightener” and the “Silent Intellectual”, while finally the motive of identification with the organization is central to the “Dissociate” as well as to the “Euphoric”. These types show the face of organized atheism to be very diverse and to be much more than and different from the caricature of “militant atheists” that has dominated public perception of the movement in recent years (in much of whatever little notice it has received). . I've actually done research on members of a specific kind of atheist, secularist, or freethought organizations in Germany and the United States (local incorporated activist atheist groups, which offer their members a chance both to socialize as well as to get active politically). Other than some similar studies that have appeared in the meantime, my aim has been not to investigate these members' worldviews, ethics, and demographics per se, but to focus on the fact of their membership. The overall research question is: What are the reasons and circumstances for (these relatively few) atheists (living in quite different socioreligious settings in the Western world) to get organized around nonreligiosity? I have set up my research design back in 2007 and have conducted my interviews in the years of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Therefore, at the workshop, I would like to present my sampling and interviewing techniques. Currently I am struggling with the (computer assisted) analysis of the huge amounts of data generated that way (which I may talk about, too, of course), and I would love to compare notes and talk about experiences with others going through this stage of qualitative research. Members of Atheist/Freethought/Secularist organizations in Germany and the United States I would like to contribute a paper documenting my current research on organized atheism in Germany and the United States. With my study, I set out to investigate the motives, experiences, and biographies of those who have become more or less active members of primarily politically oriented (rather than philosophical, academic, or congregational) atheist / freethought / secularist organizations. While focusing only on members of this particular type of organization, my aim has been to vary the members' characteristics with regard to their age, gender, duration of membership, degree of activism, and socio-religious background as much as possible. With respect to the latter aspect, I have conducted interviews with members of German IBKA (International League of Non-Religious and Atheists) and BfG (Bavarian Freethought Association) in generally atheistic Berlin, religiously mixed North Rhine Westphalia, and traditionally Catholic Bavaria, as well as with members of local chapters and affiliates of the U.S. organizations American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International in California, Minnesota, and Georgia. All in all, from the summer of 2007 until the summer of 2009, I have conducted more than sixty interviews At Oxford, I would like to briefly present the sampling method employed (both with respect to sampling organizations as well as sampling interviewees), the interviewing technique used, as well as some preliminary findings on who the members of this type of organizations are.

		"text": "Pathways to Organizational Involvement Among Nonbelievers Previous research on non-religion has often sampled for nonbelievers via their connections to nonreligious organizations. Making assumptions about nonbelievers as a whole, then, can problematic, since only a portion of nonbelievers are likely to be involved with such groups. Joining a nonreligious organization satisfies a desire for community for some nonbelievers, but social research has not adequately explained why some nonbelievers join while others do not. If nonbelievers are looking for social interaction, intellectual debate, or secular spiritual fulfillment, they can potentially find it via a nonreligious organization; however, organizational affiliation could be a sufficient but unnecessary means of achieving personal goals. This prompts me to ask, what is the difference between the joining and the non-joining nonbeliever? Have they taken different pathways to non-belief and do they experience nonbelief in significantly different ways? In order to determine why some nonbelievers choose not to participate in collective action, and to assess the actual impact of organizations on those who do, non-joiners should be compared to organization members, who may differ systematically from those who join. To answer these questions I interviewed 125 nonbelievers in Houston, Texas, most of whom were involved to varying degrees with nonreligious organizations, but many that were not. I examined respondents’ religious backgrounds, journeys to non-belief, “coming out” experiences, and organizational affiliations to search for similarities and differences in these two groups of nonbelievers. Organizational Variation in the Nonreligious Community With the rapid rise of religious non-affiliation in the United States over the past two decades, scholars have recently produced impressive work on the topic of nonreligion. However, little work has focused specifically on the role organized nonreligion plays in shaping a nonreligious identity, or the organizational variation that exists within the nonreligious community. How do different organizational types affect the development, maintenance, and salience of a nonreligious identity, and how might the individual and collective identities of members in turn affect organizational identity (i.e., the features that an organization is expected to possess)? My dissertation aims to uncover answers to these questions. I expect that a typology of nonreligious organizational identity can be developed, similar to the typologies of nonreligious individual identity currently being explored. This research will add to existing knowledge of nonreligion in the United States; American nonreligion is likely as diverse a phenomenon as American religion, and current research is only beginning to reflect this reality. I will investigate these topics using various qualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews with nonbelievers, which will include a significant sample of nonbelievers who are not involved with a nonreligious organization, in order to control for the actual effect of organizational membership on nonreligious identity. After conducting pilot research this summer, I will begin collecting data for my dissertation after defending my proposal early this fall. The proposed presentation would provide an opportunity to share preliminary results and acquire valuable feedback from experts in the field. ",

		"text": "Global Secularisms in a Post-Secular Age This volume addresses the state of and prospects for secularism globally. Drawing from multiple fields, it brings together theoretical discussion and empirical case studies that illustrate “on-the-ground,” extant secularisms as they interact with various religious, political, social, and economic contexts. Its point of departure is the fact that secularism is plural and that various secularisms have developed in various contexts and from various traditions around the world. Secular Cooperation in England and the Americas In this paper, I treat Secularism as founded by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851-52. In particular, I focus on the distinction that Holyoake maintained over the course of fifty years regarding his branch of Secularism, in the face of the broader, arguably more successful division of the movement led by Charles Bradlaugh. As distinct from Bradlaugh, for Holyoake the “secular” did not primarily signify the absence or negation of religious belief or practice. Rather, by the secular, Holyoake indicated a substantive category in its own right. Secularism itself represented a “positive” creed and movement intended to supersede or superintend both theism and atheism. Holyoake imagined and fostered the co-existence of secular and religious elements subsisting under a common umbrella. The secular and religious were figured as complementary and co-constituting aspects of what we might call, after Charles Taylor, an overarching “secularity,” but which Holyoake termed Secularism proper. Holyoake’s Secularism was not only at odds with the understanding of the Bradlaugh camp during his own lifetime but also it differs markedly from the standard secularization thesis as developed from the nineteenth century and beyond. This paper examines the movement that united atheists, skeptics, “agnostics,” and liberal theists, who might cooperate for the material improvement of humanity, especially the working classes, using Secularism as their creed. It particularly emphasizes Holyoake’s insistence on the cooperation among believers and unbelievers. It traces the movement to the Americas and examines the varieties of Secularism that came under Holyoake’s influence, or resisted it. ",

This study employs a mixed-methods approach that includes in-depth interviews (n = 19), participant observation, and one survey administered to two atheist groups, one local (n = 151) and one national (n = 456). Ethnographic findings confirm the central role of stigma, identity, and community in atheist experience and emphasize their nestedness in one another. Survey results find that atheist affiliates in both national and local groups rate political activism as more important than social reasons in motivating them to affiliate, while local affiliates rated social reasons significantly higher than national affiliates rated social reasons. Suggestions for future research include consideration of these themes’ connectedness in subsequent analyses and further inquiry into the functional divergences between local and national atheist organizations.

Based on on-site fieldwork, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with atheists at the San Diego congregation of the Sunday Assembly – one of the largest of a growing number of nonreligious/godless congregations in the United States – I explore the collective meaning-making activities and congregational identity work of this newest iteration of the broader secular and atheist community. Parallels and differences between religious and irreligious congregational and identity work, as well as the interactional, moral, symbolic, and cultural details of the proactive construction and celebration of godless worldviews through congregational activity will be explored. The concepts of – and relationships between – emotional communities, nonreligious identities, and worldview development will be brought to bear on understanding the dynamics of godless congregations. Forms, Frequency, and Correlates of Perceived Anti-Atheist Discrimination The nationally representative 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that 41% of self-identified atheists reported experiencing discrimination in the last 5 years due to their lack of religious identification.  This mixed-method study explored the forms and frequency of discrimination reported by 796 self-identified atheists living in the United States.  Participants reported experiencing different types of discrimination to varying degrees, including slander; coercion; social ostracism; denial of opportunities, goods, and services; and hate crime.  Similar to other minority groups with concealable stigmatized identities, atheists who more strongly identified with their atheism, who were “out” about their atheism to more people, and who grew up with stricter familial religious expectations reported experiencing more frequent discrimination.  Implications for future research tied to the ongoing religion/spirituality-health debate are discussed.

The theory claims that individuals in many societies may choose between religious and secular options, creating a situation of competition between religious and secular institutions. The competition between religious and secular suppliers is influenced by three important contextual factors: innovation, regulation, and resources. We give six examples of empirical studies showing that the theory of religious-secular competition explains such contrasting phenomena as the difference in success of religious healing in European and African countries, the diminishing and change of religious socialization in Switzerland, variations in church attendance in U.S. states, variation in the attractiveness of monasteries, the late secularization of Ireland, or the success of megachurches since the 1970s.

		"text": "Espousing Apostasy and Feminism? Older and Younger British Female Apostates Compared It has been acknowledged that white western men are more likely to leave their former religion behind (Altemeyer and Hunsberger, 1997, Zuckerman, 2012), or declare themselves of no religion (Brown and Lynch, 2012, Baker and Smith, 2009), than women (Beit-Hallahmi, 2007). But it has not been unknown for women, even in the past, both of the older and younger generations to do the same (Budd 1977; Schwarz 2010). This article, based on two small scale studies in the United Kingdom, considers a group of older and a group of younger women 'apostates’, to determine what leads them to do this and examines whether developing a feminist orientation plays a role. Religious women in second wave feminism were often ignored, having been considered to have chosen patriarchy over feminism while there is some evidence that women with feminist attitudes are less likely to be religious (Redfern and Aune, 2013, 154, Furseth, 2010, 210). Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis to determine overarching themes, while the three-fold typology of apostasy developed by Zuckerman (2012) allowed the authors to examine similarities and differences between older and younger women who choose to leave religion behind. They conclude reasons for apostasy are various, certainly not solely attributable to developing a feminist orientation. Taking Atheism to School Reflecting on her research among women atheists     highlights how encounters with religion in everyday life can shape experiences of lived nonreligiosity. . The Young Atheists: investigating secularism today amongst young Britons | Swiss charitable foundation the Jacobs Foundation is funding this one year small scale and qualtiative project employing the methods of semi-structured interviewing and participant observation in order to investigate British young people‟s participation with secularist organisations such as the National Secular Society and the British Humanist Association, which run activities specifically for young people. It aims to address the area of young people and secularism, providing original data on young people‟s experiences and perceptions of non-religion (secularism, atheism, humanism etc) and religion and how they think their secularist participation relates to their wider lives. The project has developed out of the Foundation‟s 2010 conference “The role of values and religion in youth development. A culture-informed perspective”, at which the absence of such data was bemoaned by scholars including José Casanova and Grace Davie. Ideas and advice on how to proceed is sought, especially as this is a relatively new area of research for both the project‟s PI (   ) and RA (   ) ",

		"text": "“'Need a Minister? How About Your Brother?’: The Universal Life Church between Religion and Non-Religion” National media outlets have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or lifecycle rituals conducted under its auspices. According to my original survey, interview, and participant observation data, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them typically self-describe as non-religious, usually as spiritual, seekers, humanist, or generically “not religious.” Similarly, they describe their weddings in “non-religious” terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most “religious” language. These “secular” or “spiritual” wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. This article explains why “secular” people select ULC ministers for their weddings, how ULC ministers see themselves as “non-religious” while being members of a legally-recognized religion, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC membership and weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as “religious” and “secular” can be co-constitutive rather than purely oppositional. Your Wedding, Your Way: Personalized, Non-Religious Weddings through the Universal Life Church Major national news outlets such as The New York Times have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or weddings conducted under its auspices. According to my initial research findings, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them self-describe as non-religious, usually as agnostic, atheist, apathetic, secular, or spiritual. Similarly, they describe their weddings in non-religious terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most religious language. These secular or spiritual wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. Using original survey, interview, and participant observation data, this paper explores why “secular” people employ ULC-ordained ministers for their weddings, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as religious and secular can be coconstitutive rather than purely oppositional.

		"text": "Discourse Analysis and the Study of Atheism: Definitions, Discourse, and Ethnographic Criticism In this post     explores a discursive approach to atheism (and nonreligion) following the theoretical work of von Stuckrad (2003).   suggests that researchers in this area move away from definitions and wrangling over the the meaning of words, and concentrate instead on the way in which these words are used; how these words are made meaningful and allowing research participants to ‘speak for themselves’. Here,   proposes that this discursive approach has methodological implications for research in this field. Atheist Exceptionalism: The Definition and Legality of Atheism under the First Amendment For my Doctoral Thesis I employed a discursive analysis to the field of scholarly definitions of Atheism in order to alleviate the need to either define the term anew, or adopt a particular definition. This methodology granted me the freedom to see how individuals might shape their Atheist identities based upon the particular influences that have shaped the scholarly discourse on how the concept itself is defined. What this paper intends is a similar analysis, using the discursive method to interpret a judicial field in order to understand how the concept is addressed, defined, and given agency by means of legal limitations. In the 17 collection of worldwide political organizations, the United States is exceptional in the sense of its intricate legal system based upon a Constitution and its subsequent Amendments, as well as the Supreme Court’s position in overseeing and determining the legality of the citizenry’s religious actions in relation to that Constitution. As a discursive field, the decisions made by the court in regards to Atheism reveal to us an interesting perspective on how the concept is defined legally, especially in relation to its 'legality’ under the First Amendment’s two clauses concerning the disestablishment of a 'national religion’ and the free exercise granted the American citizenry. This paper will discuss this 'legality’ across three case studies—public education, oath requirements, and public displays—in order to see how certain decisions by the Court have offered both a judicial definition of Atheism, as well as where this definition places Atheism—and Atheists—within the American Civil Religion.

		"text": "Universalized – Classical- Secularization Theory The classical theory of secularization remains one of the most controversial in the field of social science. According to the theory, modernization is the main reason behind the aggressive secularization process now pervading Europe. There are two main issues of discussion among respected sociologists and theologists in this regard. First, there is an ongoing debate on the meaning of the theory, especially among American and European scholars, in which they have yet to find consensus regarding the answers to the questions, “what does the theory assert?” and “what does it not assert?” The second discussion, which cannot be considered separately from the first one, is whether the theory is able to put forward a clear explanation for the bumpy relationship between religion and society in the European context and other parts of the world. In my paper, I will attempt to provide some answers to the two questions mentioned above. Firstly, I will try to shed some light on what the classical secularization theory asserts and does not assert. Then, in a clear departure from more well-known theorists like Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson, I will argue that the theory is not only valid for European societies but for every society at large. To make the theory universal in its relevance, the old classical secularization paradigm needs to be slightly revised. In attempting this, aspects of the old paradigm that belong to the history of Europe and its offshoots (Protestan Reformation) will be somewhat downplayed while those with more universal relevance (scientific advances, urbanization and industrial capitalism) will be highlighted.

		"text": "The Pope and the “Nones”: Pope Francis and the New Age of Atheism The Catholic church’s Second Vatican Council (1962-65) identified atheism as “one of the most serious problems of our time.” The council’s landmark document, The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, called for “sincere and prudent” dialogue with unbelievers in the age of secularism. Pope Paul VI (1963-78) endorsed dialogue with atheists in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam and established an unprecedented Vatican department to oversee the dialogue: the Secretariat for Non-Believers. He also commissioned the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to make the study of atheism a priority for the priestly order’s intellectual apostolate. A half century after the council, however, Catholic-atheist dialogue remains part of Vatican II’s unfinished agenda. The 2013 papal election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio has sparked new interest in dialogue between believers and unbelievers. A “Francis Effect” has been observed in various areas of ecclesial and social life—from curial reform in the Vatican to public discourse on social justice and gay marriage. This paper investigates the impact of Pope Francis on the relationship of the church to non-believers, especially the “nones” rapidly reshaping contemporary religious experience. The paper traces the development of Francis’ understanding of the phenomenon of modern unbelief from his writings as Jesuit educator and Archbishop of Buenos Aires to his principal papal messages: his encyclical Lumen Fidei, his apostolic letter Evangelii Gaudium, his 2014 World Day of Peace message, and his controversial interviews in La Repubblica and La Civiltà Cattolica. The paper seeks to advance the argument: As the church’s first Jesuit and American pope, Francis brings to his office fresh resources and unexpected perspectives that promise to fulfill Vatican II’s dream of “sincere and prudent” dialogue with the secular world.

		"text": "Irreligious Death: Making Meaning without the Theist Crutch Death is a universal experience, but the meanings and practices surrounding death vary according to cultural and temporal contexts. Examining how different groups approach end of life preparations, death practices, and grief management provides valuable insight into the varied meanings of death and the broader sociocultural context in which they exist. In the United States, death is often understood in the context of religion. As such, secular death practices and grief management is grossly understudied. This ethnographic study is an attempt to understand how individuals with an irreligious worldview handle the management of death within a hegemonic religious context where much of the language and practice surrounding death holds little meaning, and consequently, little value. Because irreligious individuals lack the social crutches provided by religion, they must find other means for confronting death and managing grief. Utilizing a “death acceptance” framework, we identity the unique challenges irreligious individuals face when reconciling the “death of self” and dealing with the “death of other” and outline various irreligious death practices and grief management strategies. We argue that the lack of institutionalized secular death culture increases the difficulty of managing death and grief, but ultimately reinforces an irreligious death acceptance perspective. By focusing inquiry on irreligious understandings, negotiations, and practices surrounding death and the ways in which these contrast with normative social practices at large, this study highlights the need for establishing a more inclusive death culture and contributes to the scholarship on the lived experience of irreligion in the United States today.

		"text": "The Collective Consciousness of Atheism Despite a doctrine of separation of church and state, religion continues to play a significant role in American politics. Churches facilitate political participation through shared interests, resources, and motivation and religion plays a substantial role in shaping morality, as well as political views and attitudes. Weber argues that the “Protestant Ethic” dominates what is normative in the social and political sphere in the United States. In this study, we examine whether religion is in fact necessary for the creation of a collective moral and political framework or whether secular individuals such as atheists are also capable of sharing a collective consciousness. We do so by asking two questions; first, does a collective political framework exist among atheists? Second, if so, how do the political attitudes of atheists differ from the Protestant majority in regards to party affiliation? We explore these questions using a multinomial logistic regression approach, utilizing data from the 2008 Pew Research Center’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, a nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults. Our results suggest that atheists are very different demographically from Protestants in terms of region, gender, education level, and generation. However, after controlling for these differences, there are still substantial differences in political views and moral attitudes between Protestants and Atheists. We argue that these differences represent differing sets of shared beliefs and moral attitudes, or collective consciousness, between Protestants and Atheist, and are not simply the result of differences in other characteristics.

		"text": "The Rise of the Nones: Politics, Spirituality, and Neo-Secularization The United States has traditionally been a “churched” nation and has often been cited by desecularization theorists as an indicator of the flawed nature of the secularization thesis; however, in the past decade, the U.S. has seen a rise of those identifying themselves as having no religious affiliation. These so-called religious “nones” have caused some debate about the future of religion in the U.S. Are there any societal reasons for this increase? Does the rise of the religious nones indicate a decline of religious belief in the United States? Does this trend give validity to the secularization thesis? In this paper, I will first evaluate the reasons for the rise of the religious nones in light of considerations from José Casanova’s article, “Rethinking Secularization: A Global Comparative Perspective.” In dialogue with Casanova, I will compare the relationship between state/ church politics and the secularization of Europe with the relationship between state/politics politics and the rise of the nones in the United States. Next, I will consider the religious make-up of the religious nones with particular attention paid to the presence of any private spirituality among this group. Appropriating the work of Rodney Stark, I will consider whether the persistence of spirituality among the nones constitutes an effective rebuttal of the secularization thesis. Finally, I will consider the work of Mark Chaves and consider whether or not neo-secularization is an adequate concept for understanding the phenomenon of the religious nones in the United States. ",

		"text": "Ninety-Eight Atheists: Atheism among the Non-Elite in Twentieth Century Britain Widespread atheism in the general population is one of the defining characteristics of twentieth-century British society, yet until very recently, it has largely been unregarded by historians. This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced 'irreligious socialisation’, rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12–18% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as 'unarticulated causes’ of the subjects’ irreligion. . My current study is looking at the influence of non-elite atheists on the social history of twentieth century Britain and in particular on their impact on the progress of secularization in the period 1900 – 1980. I‟m using oral histories and autobiographies to reveal how people described their own loss of faith and the age at which this occurs. In the last ten years the social history of religion in Britain has been dominated by the idea that the 'religious crisis' of the 1960s marked a watershed in the dechristianisation of Britain. Historians have suggested a variety of causal explanations for this, however, atheist apostasy is not amongst them. My work shows that apostates dechristianised from the beginning of the century and unbelief spread in the non-elite population until it was able to find expression in public discourse during the social revolution of the 1960s. In the preceding decades there were atheistic sub-cultures such as radical politics or university education which allowed some to realise their unbelief, yet others rejected religion with little apparent external influence. Apostasy tended to occur during adolescence, so we must look to the influences on children that shape beliefs, such as parenting, peer attitudes, education and entertainment, to explain how atheist apostates came to reject religious socialisation.

		"text": "Secular Students and Spirituality Within higher education and student affairs, it has become very common to provide programming related to “spirituality” of college students, based on the premise that everyone is spiritual. Using data from a national study of college student spirituality conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute, I will investigate to the extent to which the concepts of spirituality as defined in the study are applicable to secular students in the sample. The original study, conducted from 2003-2007 used principle components analysis to identify factors related to spirituality, religion, and related qualities (which they defined as charitable involvement, ethical involvement, etc.). A major conclusion from the study was that today’s college students have very high levels of spiritual interest and involvement. My study seeks to understand whether that holds true for secular students. Preliminary findings suggest that secular students score lower than the overall sample on measures of spirituality and religion, but they score only slightly lower on the related qualities measures. I conclude that many of the topics called “spirituality” are salient for secular students, however, the concept is not universally applicable. A practical implication based on these findings is that educators should begin with the broad concept of “Pathways to Purpose,” or “Purpose, Meaning, and Values” (rather than defining that as spirituality) to create a more inclusive environment. Framing programming in this way will broaden conversations so students can position themselves in the conversation in ways that are authentic to them, whether they are spiritual, religious, secular, or some combination. Do Atheism and Feminism Go Hand-in-Hand?: A Qualitative Investigation of Atheist Men’s Perspectives about Gender Equality Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 10 self-identified atheist men in the American Midwest, this qualitative study explored their perspectives regarding atheism, gender, and feminism. The data was analyzed using consensual qualitative research methodology (Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997). Results indicated these men had a proclivity for freethought—a commitment to questioning things and prioritizing reason over all else. They believed gender differences were primarily due to cultural and social influence in society. Gender inequality was highlighted as a problem within the U.S. and throughout the world, however this belief did not necessarily lead to being feminist-identified. There appeared to be a pathway linking their intellectual orientation, atheism, and belief in gender equality. ",

		"text": "If Given Clear Evidence for the Existence of a God, How Do Atheists and Agnostics Think They Would Respond? How do atheists and agnostics imagine that they would respond in two hypothetical situations: 1) being presented with clear evidence that a god actually did exist and 2) encountering this god, with a choice to approach, stand still, or move away? Adult participants (N = 520) from the U.S. completed an online survey via Amazon’s MTurk. Only those who endorsed nonbelief in any god on a screening question completed the survey. Results suggested that nonbelievers varied considerably in their imagined responses to god-focused evidence and encounters. On Likert items (consolidated through factor analysis), confusion was endorsed most, then fear, a loss of freedom, and positive emotion (these three did not differ), then anger, then guilt/ shame. An open-ended item revealed responses not tapped in the Likert items, including shock/surprise, continued skepticism, curiosity, awe, and decisions about whether to follow the god and whether/how to change one’s life and beliefs. In terms of the imagined encounter, most participants reported preferences to approach or stand still vs. moving away. In comparison to agnostics, atheists (especially “closed” atheists) imagined more negatively valenced responses (e.g., more anger, more loss of freedom, less positive emotion, less approach behavior, and more avoidance). In general, more positively valenced emotions and behaviors were associated with greater age, higher agreeableness and conscientiousness, lower neuroticism, more positive ratings of the (hypothetical) god’s attributes, more struggles involving religious doubts, less certainty about one’s nonbelief, fewer interpersonal struggles around religion, and fewer microaggressions related to one’s nonbelief.

Smith (2011, 2013), LeDrew (2013), Cimino and Smith (2007, 2011, 2012), and Guenther et al. (2013) point both directly and indirectly to the need for a dialogue on how to describe America’s “nonbelievers.” Cragun and Hammer (2011) have provided sage advice for avoiding tacit pro-religiosity, though much discussion remains. Namely, should scholars treat humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, naturalists, and non-theists as a single group, and how carefully should they attend to the particularities ascribed to these terms by those who adopt them? This paper relies on 65 in-depth interviews with the leaders and members of America’s major nonbeliever organizations in order to provide concrete examples of how leaders from various types of groups understand their own labels and those of others. Because there is no consensus among these leaders, I couch my analysis within their interorganizational politics, and I observe the ways in which they both emphasize and minimize differences among the terms depending on the context. I then look at how scholars in our burgeoning field have chosen to describe these various groups, with the aim of offering some tentative suggestions on how to attend to the differences between them while still making use of efficacious umbrella categories. My hope is to spur a dialogue among those in attendance that I believe would be as helpful for others’ research and writing as I am certain it would be for my own. ",

		"text": "Religious Actions Speak Louder than Words: Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs) Predicts Theism and Non-theism A central claim of the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that pan-human cognitive mechanisms explain supernatural agent beliefs. This claim faces the challenge of accounting for nontheism. More precisely, if nearly all human beings possess the cognitive mechanisms outlined by CSR scholars, then how do we explain patterns in the presence of theists and non-theists? Evolutionary anthropologist Joseph Henrich has proposed the existence of a psychological bias focused on “Credibility Enhancing Displays” (CREDs). We are biased, Henrich argues, to believe the representations we receive from others to the extent that they 'walk the walk’ and not just 'talk the talk’. The implication for theism and non-theism is that individuals will be much less likely to acquire the theistic beliefs of their communities if they are not exposed to sufficient levels of CREDs. We will present new evidence from a diverse sample of Americans suggesting that CREDs exposure, as measured by our recently validated scale (alpha= .92), predicts theism vs. non-theism (B= .519, p< .01), all while controlling for religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for theism. They suggest that actions do indeed speak louder than words in convincing individuals of the reality of supernatural agents and that, to be successfully transmitted, religious commitments must be embodied.

Sociologists from Max Weber and Emile Durkheim to modern theorists such as Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson have argued that as societies modernize there is a dramatic decline in religious adherence, authority, and influence. Alternative models, which stress the centrality of free-markets and the inverse correlation between existential security and religiosity, are posited to explain the exceptional position of modern societies that remain highly religious. The pages that follow apply the theories above in order to elucidate the process of secularization in the Iranian context. Two questions are germane to this task: 1.) How has Khomeini’s Islamic Revolution, the quintessential example of political Islam, led to the demise of Islamist tendencies in Iran and 2.) Why does Iran, although modern in many regards, continue to be highly religious. ",

		"text": "Transformations of Self and Society in Modern Egypt According to measures such as the World Values Survey, Muslim-majority nations like Egypt constitute the most religious, and thus the least secularized, regions of the globe. Voices of atheism can be heard in Egypt, and they are becoming more forceful, but they are rare and draw attention more for their novelty than their social and political significance. Indeed, rational discussions about secularism/secularization in Egypt have been made difficult by an array of factors: the legacy of Western colonialism, authoritarian politics, a forceful Islamist opposition, and ongoing cultural debates about modern identity and authenticity. But signs of liberalism are evident in the emerging consumer culture. Egyptians are coming to see themselves, and express their identities, like many others around the world: in terms of class and the power to consume. And this trend has opened up the possibility for what one author has termed “cultural extroversion”—the capacity of Muslims to interpret lifestyle choice as coincident with religion. My presentation will explore the growing trend in self-help and personal development literature in Egypt, situating it within the demands of global capitalism and the psychological values of the enterprising self. Self-help, whether in Egypt or the US, legitimizes a turn inward, to explore and nurture the true self—a self often portrayed as hidden or suppressed by the dictates of traditional mores. The result of such self-exploration is not a rejection of Islam as much as it is its transvaluation: envisioning Muhammad as the Muslim Dale Carnegie or Allah as life coach. Through an analysis of selfhelp literature, I will analyze how the inroad of capitalism in Egypt is reshaping notions of the self, away from traditional Islamic notions to a self more in line with global capitalist culture.

		"text": "The Politics of Secularism and the Paradox of a ChristianAmerican Ethos This paper analyzes the presence of secularization debates in the political arena in order to reveal a prevalent paradoxical Christian-American ethos. In short, this paper argues that those who are concerned with the encroachment of “secularism” are themselves secularizing various aspects of “religion” when engaging in the political process. Citing multiple examples, but focusing on one case study in more depth – the Mount Soledad Cross controversy - this paper argues that in each of these cases, those who seek to defend “the religious” from the threat of “secularism” are ultimately the ones doing the secularizing. Since 1913, some form of a cross has stood in the center of a public city park atop Mount Soledad in San Diego, California despite efforts by separationists to remove it who claim that its existence and maintenance is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Defenders of the cross argue that its existence on public land is Constitutional because the cross is not a religious symbol. Rather, they argue that the cross should be understood as a secular symbol – one that represents American identity, patriotism, and military service. This particular approach, I argue, is representative of a wider, paradoxical Christian-American ethos where “defenders of Christianity” resort to secularizing “the religious” as an attempt to preserve what they hold to be sacred. In order to preserve the cross in its current location, appellants are arguing that the cross has been divested of its religious meaning. In the end, such tactics contribute to, rather than defend against, the secularization process. ",

		"text": "The Nones Shall Always Be with Us: Toward an Historical Perspective on Unbelief in America The years of the 21st century have been marked by the heightened visibility of the American community of Unbelief (atheists, humanists, freethinkers), a growth of Christian antiatheist rhetoric led by periodic papal pronouncements, and the most recent discovery of a seemingly growing community of “nones,” people variously defined as disassociated from any religious community and/or lacking any religious preference/ identity, which has led at times to the nones being identified with the community of Unbelief in things religious or supernatural. Reflection on this state of affairs is provided by an assemblage of two sets of data. First, the historical data on religious affiliation in America through the 19th and early 20th centuries indicates that the “nones” provided a far greater percentage of the population, being the majority in the decades prior to World War II. Simultaneously, unbelief, first manifest at the end of the 18th century as deism, survived and grew through the 19th century as freethought and through the 20thcentury in a variety of movements—Ethical Culture, Marxism, atheism, and Humanism. By 1940, some 4 to 5 percent of the population identified themselves as non-theists. Projecting the historical trends into the future, the Unbelief community has grown substantially through the last half of the twentieth century to the present, though it remains as the same 4 to five percent of the population (12 to 15 million. In that time, however, it has developed more than a half-dozen national organizations, each with local communities scattered across the continent, an organized base that provides the potential of substantial growth in the next generation.

This has left a fundamental gap in our understanding: What reasons do nonbelievers themselves give for their nonbelief? Drawing on previous studies, this project aimed to develop and provide initial validity testing of a measure to capture these reasons: the Reasons of Atheists/Agnostics for 8 Nonbelief in God’s Existence Scale (RANGES). Participants (N = 520) were adults drawn from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk worker database. An initial item pool was developed based on a review of relevant literature and responses to open-ended questions in prior studies. The item pool was refined based on feedback from several academic researchers and non-academics who write about nonbelief. Responses to the measure were subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed a ninefactor solution: Socialization-Past, Socialization-Current, Bad Experiences with Religion, Societal Concerns, Intellectual, God Relational, Emotional, Intuitive, and Agnostic. The obtained factors were subjected to initial validity testing across a number of variables, including attitudes toward God or religion and previous measures of nonreligious identity and doubt. Correlation and multiple regression generally supported the construct validity of the measure’s subscales. Nonbelievers endorsed Intellectual reasons most strongly, followed by Agnostic, Societal Concerns, and Intuitive reasons. God Relational, Bad Experiences with Religion, Emotional, and Socialization reasons for nonbelief were endorsed less strongly. These results can help inform our understanding of the structure of nonbelief. ",

		"text": "Believing and Belonging – or not?: Trends and Predictors of Religious Belief and Belonging in the United States In the last two decades, religious scholars and pundits have increasingly argued that Europeans and Americans “believe, but don’t belong.” It is a comforting analysis for people with religious commitments, since it suggests that the rising proportion of people who don’t identify with religion, nonetheless believe in the Christian gods or the divine inspiration of Christian sacred texts. Yet, recent studies also show that belief in gods are also on the wane, and that more Americans reject the divine inspiration for Christian sacred texts. Further, many who do not believe are compelled to identify with religious groups or to participate in religious services, and this may well have been the norm in prior generations. In this paper, I use data from the 1984-2012 General Social Surveys to examine trends in believing and belonging. I focus on two measures of religious belief—non-theism and secular views of the Bible, and two measures of religious belonging—non-identification and less than yearly religious participation. I compare trends over time and across generations for (1) believing belongers; (2) believers who don’t belong; (3) non-believers who belong; and (4) people who don’t believe or belong. I estimate sets of multinomial logistic regression models to examine how patterns of belief and belonging are influences by demographic factors and childhood religious identification. ",

		"text": "“I Know It When I See It:” Humanism, Secularism, and Religious Taxonomy Few outside the academic study of religion have thought very hard about how “religion” might be defined. If pressed, they may employ the same definition that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart used when he defined “hard-core pornography” in 1964: “I know it when I see it.” The tendency toward such an intuitive definition of religion opens the door to confusion in communication—and potentially in policy. For most Americans, the terms “religion” and “church,” when used to describe broader categories, retain Christian connotations of structure, belief, and practice. These connotations are retained when they attempt to describe—in terms of religion—“secular humanism” or other quasi-religious philosophies or movements. This paper argues that secular humanism is a disruptive concept that brings to light the normative quality of religious worldviews. This paper will examine how observers who “know it when they see it” have taxonomized secular humanism and other examples of non-religion/irreligion as religions. The inclusion since the 1920s of “humanism” in catalogues of religious movements shows an evolving response to the concept that shifts with the perceived prevalence of irreligion in society, as well as the relationship between religion, irreligion, and the state. The modern case study of the Sunday Assembly, a “godless church” that started in England in 2013 and has toured North America seeding new congregations, provides a useful example of how the criteria of belief, ritual, dogma, and community are employed by both critics and supporters of the movement to evaluate its religious/ irreligious/non-religious status.

		"text": "Michel Foucault, Religion & the Theatrical Work of Jerzy Grotowski In this paper I will locate the work of Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski (1933 – 1999) in the context of Michel Foucault’s poststructuralist concepts, particularly those regarding the body, history and Christianity. I will investigate two plays within Grotowski’s Theatre of Productions phase to see if they indeed did manifest the boundary-defying exploration of ideological structures that Foucault’s inquiries offer to religious studies work. I will then delve more specifically into the use of what religious studies scholar Thomas Beaudoin calls a 'Foucaultian imperative’ in art, demonstrating that Grotowski’s work could be seen to manifest a new way of religious knowing through a secular realization of theatre art. I will use Foucault’s work through the traditions of religious studies scholars Jeremy Carrette and James Bernauer to challenge the place of the body in the understanding of religion. By using Foucault as an interpretive theoretical framework, religion and the body can be linked much more effectively. I will explore the impact and resonance of these ideas as they exist in the secular productions of Grotowski’s early theatre career. I will examine Grotowski’s art in light of these critiques, notably exploring Grotowski’s work in light of Carrette’s assessment of Foucault’s 'spiritual corporality.’ In so doing I will explore how the religious studies work on Foucault provides an interpretive lens through which to view these productions as a challenge to the boundaries and limits of spiritual experience. The secular form of theatre art can then be explored as a means of experiencing the sacred. ",

		"text": "Examining Low Religiousness Among University Students in Istanbul College students in Istanbul are surrounded by considerable contradictions. The life-style of a cosmopolitan European city beckons, but family life frequently retains traditional values such as skepticism of western behaviors like dating. A key source of tension for young people is religion. Turkey has a history as a secular state, but religious political parties and culturally powerful groups like Gülen have grown in importance in recent decades. To learn more about religious attitudes among young adults in this rapidly changing region, we surveyed 200 students at Istanbul University. Students completed an Islamic version of the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS), along with personality measures. Using the ROS categories, 37% of students were high on both intrinsic and extrinsic subscales, 13% were extrinsic, 14% intrinsic, while 36% were low/nonreligious. This group responded 'disagree’ on average to most questions, thus rejecting statements such as Unless conditions are blocked, I fast in the month of Ramadan. In several recent western studies, possessing an analytical reasoning style was associated with atheism. We examined this using the Cognitive Reflections Test (CRT) and the Rational Experiential Inventory (REI). To obtain correct answers on the math problems of the CRT, respondents must inhibit responding with an intuitive but false answer. Correct answers on the CRT negatively correlated with ROS extrinsic orientation, r= -0.45. The REI sub-scores measuring Rational Engagement correlated with ROS extrinsic at r= -0.35, a new finding in the literature (our team previously found a trend in this direction with American college students). No relationships were found between religiousness and the broader autism phenotype (using the Autism Quotient) in contrast to several western studies. Interview data with a small number of students revealed multiple reasons for atheism and low religiousness, but a salient issue was perceived incompatibility between scientific theories (especially evolution) and religious teachings.

		"text": ". In the heady days that followed the stunning success of The God Delusion, Letter to a Christian Nation, and the rest of the New Atheist works, it should come as little surprise that publishers determined that the moment was right to follow up these semiphilosophical works with the memoirs of atheists. For if, the reasoning seems to have gone, the reading public was ready to read strongly anti-religious works of the polemical type it stood to reason they would be interested in reading the stories of how people became atheists, especially in a book culture as saturated with memoirs as our own. But if the emergence of the atheist memoir is not that surprising, what is a little more surprising is the emergence of a whole new genre of spiritual autobiography, what I will call the “deconversion story,” in which the memoirist accounts for their loss of faith (usually in Christianity) in strikingly (and often self-consciously) parallel terms to the conversion narratives of that faith. So where one had come to Jesus before now one embraces atheism. Where there are a number of criticisms one might level against this structure (not least the rather strange instance of converting to a belief you don’t have) and against the New Atheist polemic more generally, these deconversion stories are particularly interesting given that so much of the New Atheist polemic (as noted by critics like David Bentley Hart and Terry Eagleton) is rooted in anecdotes and personal narratives rather than abstract argument. In addition to an engagement with the structural imperatives of the conversion narrative form, I argue recent discussions in cognitive science and psychology, especially debates about both memory and belief formation, may be helpful in understanding the form and especially the content of the deconversion narrative. In effect I suggest that these neurological axioms diagnose an etiology of one of the more perplexing trends in recent life writing about nonreligion: the degree to which conversion relies upon narratives of experience whereas deconversion seems to rely upon narratives of evidence.

It shows that certain combinations of those three variables are far more common than others, and demonstrates changes over time in the percentage of people belonging to each cluster, with a trend toward diminishing religiosity. The paper identifies socio-demographic and geographic factors that are associated with the religiosity cluster to which a person belongs. The paper examines the ability of the new scale to predict how people will answer questions on contentious societal issues, using belief in evolution as a case study. The most religious definitely reject human evolution while the most secular definitely believe in it. ",

		"text": "Nonreligion, Secularism, and Cosmopolitanism Nonreligion and secularism may undermine traditional political authority as well as traditional religious commitment. This may be why Locke warned that atheism “dissolves all.” If we turn away from religion, some may worry that there remains no firm foundation for political authority. There is, in fact, a close connection between atheism and anarchism (see  , 2013). Bakunin, for example, rejected both “God and the State.” However, in the contemporary world, secular political authority remains the best pragmatic mechanism for the development of nonreligion, since secular political systems defend the rights of nonbelievers. There is no denying, however, that the nonreligious standpoint is skeptical of unjustified authorities and traditions. This skepticism can easily extend toward skeptical critiques of traditional political affiliations. This presentation will discuss connections between nonreligion and cosmopolitan or anti-political (even anarchistic) ideas. ",

While previous research suggests that nonbelievers are able to create images of divine figures, the content of these images had not been thoroughly investigated. We asked nonbelievers from the United States if they could form an image of a hypothetical divine figure. Of 520 participants, 81% were able to form an image of a divine figure. While images based on popular religious teachings were the most common, images based on previously held religious beliefs and other personal ideas were also reported. Participants then rated the characteristics of the hypothetical divine figure using the God-10, which measures the degree to which a divine figure is seen as cruel, distant, or loving. Compared to religious believers, nonbelievers described their imagined divine figures as somewhat crueler and substantially more distant and less loving. Participants later answered two questions about what they would say in an encounter with an imagined god and how this god would respond. Most participants did respond to these questions, and several themes emerged which paralleled the God-10 results. While many nonbelievers asked questions about the purpose of suffering and the god’s absence, there were few angry responses or accusations of sadism. These results show that nonbelievers can generate robust and informative images of a hypothetical god figure. ",

		"text": "Building Bridges in the Shadows of Steeples: Active Atheists and the Negotiation of Community and Identity in a Theistic Culture Atheists are an ideological minority in the United States. Atheists who actively seek out like-minded others are even fewer and farther between. Based on 30 in-depth interviews with active atheists (atheists who participate in some type of secularly oriented club or organization), this paper explores the ways in which secular individuals construct and maintain community within an overwhelmingly theistic society. Findings suggest that boundary work in face-to-face community settings helps to crystallize individual and group identity as they navigate through a social world that, for the most part, disagrees with them. Like any ideological camp, the atheist movement, and the small organizations investigated in this study, encounter plenty of diverging opinions from inside their organizations as well. Additionally, this group utilizes new media and social networking online as a component of community as well as a platform for building and broadcasting identity. This paper begins the work of assessing if and how atheist use of online social networking affects their “real life” interactions with one another as well as with those who oppose their views. This paper not only contributes to an area of sociology that has long been neglected, it does so with data sourced directly from the population involved. In this piece atheists are asked to speak for themselves and the findings discuss the above issues in the words of those involved. ",

		"text": "The Resurrection of The Sociology of Irreligion    , Professor Emeritus in Sociology, was a pioneer in the social scientific study of irreligion but after the 1971 publication of his groundbreaking book, Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, he — and sociology — moved in other directions. On the republication of this classic work,   reflects on the rise and fall — and rise again — of the project he originally conceived of over four decades ago. The Sociology of Irreligion: Past and Present It would be wrong to suppose that irreligion is a creation of the twentieth century. Although we are accustomed to hearing the age we live in described as the 'secular age’ or the 'age of doubt’, previous periods of history could justifiably be similarly labelled. To the Christians of the time, the last years of the Roman Empire must have seemed a time in which scepticism and heresy flourished, just as to the orthodox Christian of the eighteenth century the rise of Deism and the French Revolution indicated that he was living in an 'age of infidelity’. Even the Middle Ages, frequently treated as the epitome or an era of faith, was seen by medieval writers as a time of spiritual crisis, in which witchcraft, heresy and paganism were constant threats to the faith. The principal reason why our perspective of history is such that we view our own time as characteristically irreligious and contrast it with what we believe to be the prevailing faith of all previous epochs is because we live in the shade of the late nineteenth century. And it is the religious activity of that period which we tend to use as the yardstick by which to measure our own lack of faith. ",

		"text": "The Sunday Assembly In our second blog post     discusses her experience of attending the Sunday Assembly in London, and reflects on the broader issues of nonreligious community, ritual action and meaning. . Scholarly understandings of the growth of secularism in the 20th century assumed the retreat of religion into the private sphere, yet an upsurge in public expressions of religious practice have been observed in recent years in which material culture and new technologies play a vital role (Morgan 2008, Keane 2008). Such developments compound the need for greater critical comprehension of lived experiences of secularism, as highlighted by leading scholars including Professor Linda Woodhead, at the AHRC Innovative Methods in the Study of Religion conference (2010; also Asad 2009, Cannell 2010). Accordingly I shall conduct the first ethnographic study of explicit public enactments and experiences of secularism and nonreligious values in the UK, interrogating contemporary notions of secularism and its entanglement with religious practice. I will focus on individuals and groups in Britain mobilising publicly around values of non-religion and secularism, exploring their ritual symbolism, verbal and visual language; I will document the range of emergent material forms, rituals and networks using visual ethnographic methods (Banks 1999, Pink 2001). Preliminary research into the 2008 “Atheist Bus Campaign”, initiated in direct response to religious advertising campaigns, highlighted the significance of visual and verbal non-religious performance, including advertising and networking locally and internationally through new media. I anticipate that many contemporary public expressions of non-religion area response to public religious expressions in a multi-religious context and draw on historically embedded Christian ideology (Cannell 2005).

		"text": "Othering and the theist/atheist dialectic The obvious answer to the question “what is an atheist?” is: someone who doesn’t believe in God. But that doesn’t get us any further if we don’t know what it means to believe in God. It takes knowing the meaning of hair to understand what it is to be bald. But whom should we ask what it means to believe in God? Theists or atheists? Both strategies might lead to very different answers. After all, a theist is likely to consent that a belief in God is meaningful, perhaps even necessary or rational, while an atheist will probably take a belief in God to be unnecessary, a human construct, perhaps even confusing, undesirable or irrational. In addition, both theists and atheists may be divided on the question of how to demarcate a believer in God from a non-believer in God. Is God something that does or does not exist, which would mean that the theist and the atheist disagree on a belief in God’s existence? (I will call this demarcation strategy the ‘God-existence’ strategy) Or is a belief in God more like a relation or attitude towards certain experiences or elements of human nature, like moral or aesthetic elements of life, which theists would identify with God, while atheists don’t? (I will call this the ‘God-experience’ strategy) And there are other possibilities. In this paper, I argue that clear demarcation strategies are in themselves political tactics and involve the danger of Othering, in a way much like Simone de Beauvoir discusses in The Second Sex. I will use the strategies I just mentioned, the ‘God-existence’ strategy and the ‘God-experience’ strategy, as examples. ",

Merino indicated that „recent birth cohorts of Americans are more likely than previous cohorts to be raised outside of a religious tradition” and „those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religion as adults” (Merino, 2012). Unlike this study interested in those raised with no religion, we’ll try to identify in datebases like GSS, ISSP, EVS, WVS and ESS those people who declare themselves as nonreligious or atheists although they were raised in a religious tradition and had religiously afiliated parents. We intend to find out in this paper if we can discuss, forcing the concept, about a conversion to nonreligion. Who are those who became nonreligious? Why and how they become nonreligious? are some questions we’ll try to answer in our paper.

		"text": "Questioning the invisibility of non-religion in the contemporary workplace: a process of accommodation? This paper is based upon an interim analysis of a PhD study into the contemporary workplace as seen through the eyes of twenty Quaker interviewees. It questions whether ‘religion’ or ‘nonreligion’ descriptors can be meaningfully applied to modern work organisations. This analysis of the research data is based upon viewing organisations as processual, rather than fixed and structured, entities. Organisations are understood as a confluence of individual, subjective, meaning-making and processes of identity accommodation. (Parker, 2008) Taking the view that subjective identities are fundamentally grounded beyond the organisational form, and articulated at the point of multi-various decision-making within the job role, analysis of the data suggests that the interviewees’ complex motivations remain largely invisible in organisational terms. The interviewees can be regarded as engaging in private articulations of multi-faceted personal beliefs within a locus of public discourse. Within this discourse, Quaker belief is a singular, variously significant aspect of the interviewees’ subjective identity. However, engagement with the requirements of the work role, and contestation of organisational norms in the particular, reveal a more complex articulation of the subjective self that undermines a religious/non-religious binary definition. The paper concludes that individuals in modern, technical-rational organisations (Bauman, 1989) bring a multi-faceted subjectivity to their work which cannot be recognised readily within formal organisational discourses. It suggests finally that subjective identities are organisationally significant, and through their religious/non-religious invisibility, have the potential to shape, unrecognised and fundamentally, the identity of the collective whole.

The Adult Religious Preferences of Individuals Raised with No Religion Recent birth cohorts of Americans are more likely than previous cohorts to be raised outside of a religious tradition. In addition, those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religious preference as adults. Despite their growing numbers, individuals raised with no religion have received little attention from scholars. The adult religious preferences of these individuals provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test theories of religion and social change. Using General Social Survey data, I examine the adult religious preferences and beliefs of individuals raised with no religion. I provide evidence of a shift in socialization and social influences experienced by those who report growing up with no religion. Compared with earlier cohorts raised with no religion, more recent cohorts have had more secular upbringings and tend to be more secular, liberal, and wary of organized religion as adults. They are also more likely to have a religiously unaffiliated spouse, if they marry at all. Results from a logistic regression analysis indicate that these trends explain much of the cohort differences in the likelihood of remaining unaffiliated as an adult. ",

		"text": "In spite of Christianity: Humanism and its others in contemporary Britain What do we talk about when we talk about religion? What do we recognize as essential and specific to any given faith, and why? In this lecture, I address these questions by drawing on fieldwork among humanists in Britain, paying particular attention to humanism’s relation to Christianity. In one way or another, humanists often position themselves in relation to Christianity. In a basic way, this has to do with humanists’ commitment to secularism—the differentiation of church and state. In more complex ways, though, it also has to do with an effort to move “beyond” Christianity—to encourage a world in which reason takes the place of revelation—while often, at the same time, recognizing what’s worth saving and even fostering from the legacies of faith. All these various relations and perspectives suggest how we should understand social life in contemporary Britain as what it is in spite of Christianity—and not. . My training in the anthropology of religion has resulted in two major projects to date, both on Christianity: the first in Zimbabwe; the second in England. In the latter, which ran from 2006- 2009, and focused on an ecumenical, evangelical charity devoted to promoting the Bible and its image, I became increasingly interested in what many evangelicals see as their public-sphere foils: secular humanists. Indeed, in much of the work for this project, secular humanists, 'atheist fundamentalists,' and other such figures--real and discursive--played a significant role. It struck me that an ethnography of humanism in the UK would be a good follow-on project, and that's exactly what I plan to do starting this January, when I begin ESRC-funded fieldwork on the British Humanist Association. Although I have yet to do sustained research on humanism, I am interested, at the methodological level, in several issues, such as how categories like 'belief' figure differently (or not) than in research on Christians, and how the dynamic between individuals and institutions plays out within a movement that is driven by traditions of 'free thinking.'

Various institutions – the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CIA, the World Values Survey, Gallup, and many others – have performed sophisticated statistical analyses on cross-national data. The present investigation demonstrates that valid and reliable data concerning religiosity and secularity exist for most countries and that these data are comparable. Cross-national data relating to social, political, economic and cultural aspects of life were tested for correlation with religiosity/secularity. In contrast to the most widely accepted general account of secularity, the Existential Security Framework (ESF; Norris & Inglehart, 2004), secularity was not most highly related to material security, though these were highly related. Rather, secularity was most strongly related to the degree of formal education attained. Material security explained no significant variance beyond education. Thus, religion’s primary function in the world today is being replaced, not so much by the pseudo-materialistic supplication for better living conditions as posited by the ESF, but by contemporary education – extensive knowledge of contemporary cultures, philosophy, modes of thought or processes of reasoning.

		"text": "Modes of Non-Religiosity In academic no less than popular thought, India is frequently represented as the quintessential land of religion. Disenchanting India qualifies this representation through an analysis of the contemporary Indian rationalist organisations (those that affirm the values and attitudes of atheism, humanism or free-thinking).To understand the genesis of organised rationalism in India the book addresses the rationalists’ emphasis on maintaining links to atheism and materialism in ancient India and outlines their strong ties to the intellectual currents of modern European history. At the heart of Disenchanting India lies an ethnography of the organisation “Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti” (Organisation for the Eradication of Superstition) based in Maharashtra. This account describes the organization’s efforts to promote a scientific temper and combat the beliefs and practices it regards as superstitious. It also includes an analysis of rationalism in the day to day lives of its members and in relation to the organization’s controversial position within Indian society.The book outlines the distinguishing characteristics of this organisation through a depiction of the rationalists’ specific “mode of unbelief” in comparison to “modes of religiosity”. Alongside a critical engagement with the work of Max Weber and Charles Taylor, the theoretical discussion of modes of unbelief further provides an original basis for comparative studies of similar movements in a trans-cultural perspective. Finally, Disenchanting India can be situated within the contemporary debates about the nature of rationalism in Indian intellectual life and cultural politics. It thereby engages with debates that are as crucial for Anthropology and Religious Studies as they are for Post-colonial Studies, Sociology and History. . My interests are: 1) How to describe non-religion positive, i.e. not against the respective religious default positions (not 'parasitic' on religion)? 2) How to compare non-religion / 'modes of unbelief' in a trans-cultural framework? 3) How to research religious indifference (eg. how to access them, specify a sample, ...)? My research activities are: 1) Fieldwork (PhD) on rationalist / atheist / humanist organizations in India 2) History of the criticism of religion(s) in Europe 3) Naturalism in the social sciences ",

I am currently developing a proposal to investigate the meanings and values around Christian festivals such as Christmas and Easter for those at the fringes of Christian belief (i.e. those willing to celebrate major Christian festivals but who would not participate in formal religion) and why these festivals carry such popular salience. One method I hope to utilise is video diary and video elicitation interviews. Basically, this will be a project seeking to identify the benefits people accrue through celebrating Christian festivals in a secular context, including a consideration of familial ties, nostalgia, consumerism and gendered work (such festivals involve a huge amount of planning and organisation, where traditional gendered divisions of labour may be reinscribed, despite increased egalitarianism in other spheres). It is thus focusing on religion and secularism at a cultural crossroads, where the religious and the secular are at an intersection or boundary, embedded in each other, but where politics of meaning are fraught and contested (Knott 2005). This is borne out by the Christian distaste of Christmas consumerism, often portrayed in outlets such as the 'Church Times', or by the incongruence in popularity of Christmas carol services, where cathedrals and churches are filled to the brim with participants who may never set foot into a church at any other time of year. Although studies addressing the popular salience of Christian festivals in a secular context have been addressed in the United States (E.g. Pleck 2000), to my knowledge there is very little work being carried out in the UK. ",

But crucially they also ridicule these traits in non-religious people. The ultimate target of their ridicule is distinction between the religious and non-religious. They laugh with those they ridicule. The latter three, by contrast, ridicule traits from a position of superiority. Their target is an outsider group that they distance themselves from. They do not sympathise with religious people but laugh at them. The evidence of this diversity adds empirical substance to postsecularist critiques and so undermines a common discourse that conceives of ridicule as a homogeneous form. The differences between these forms are essential to understanding the sociological implications of the ridicule of religion, particularly in poorly understood political events such as the Danish Cartoons.

The project covers the reception of apocalypse in various contexts from the early middle age until contemporary times. I am concerned with the apocalypse of the 20th and 21st century. As a literary scholar I meanly analyze fiction and to some extent film, but I also catch try to catch a glimpse of apocalyptic prophecy in science. In a postmodern context the concept of the end has changed fundamentally. There seem to be not just one end, but a plurality of possible ends: The End of history, the end of class struggle, the end of philosophy, the death of God, the end of religions, the end of Christianity and morals […], the end of the subject, the end of man, the end of the West, the end of Oedipus, the end of the earth, Apocalypse now […]”. (Derrida 1983). Some key questions concerning the “secularized apocalypse” are: In a secularized age thinking the end is not any more a practice restricted to religion. Scientific models dominate our picture of the end of the world. Wars, ecological disasters, and cosmic catastrophes have the power to destroy the world as we know it. In this context apocalypse becomes an umbrella term for many phenomena which all have in common a complete or near complete destruction of the world. In a biblical sense from this point a renewal of the world would happen. But is this the case in a secularized apocalypse? What happens after the Day X if there is no hope for an intervention from god? Is there still space for a vision of a new and better world or is it just the survival of some unlucky people in an unpleasant place which once had been our world? ",

		"text": ". Non-religion, dissent and the internet in Egypt | My research addresses the ways in which nonreligious positions are constructed and contested in Egypt at this point in time. Religiosity (whether Muslim or Christian) marks a common ground in the Muslim-majority country. Deconversion from Islam and declaring oneself non-religious is both legally and socially highly problematic. My fieldwork in Cairo has been conducted among individuals that overwhelmingly know each other through the internet, and have formed discussion groups with like-minded individuals both on- and offline. These groups and meetings provide a space to speak freely about ideas that are normally off-limits among family, friends or colleagues. The research has focused both on the role the internet plays in forging a space for such exchanges, as well as the issues that are bound up with declaring oneself non-religious (opposition to rise of Islamism and religious pressures, concerns with modernity).My project has at its heart a normalisation of the common view of religion‟s role in the region, demonstrating that while religion is a powerful force in the Arab Middle East, its role is never uncontested.

		"text": "The 'return of religion' and the return of the criticism of religion: The 'New Atheism' in recent German and American culture Criticism of religion can be found throughout the ages, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. It appears that history of religions itself can be interpreted as continued criticisms of one religion against another (e.g. Christianity as criticism of Judaism and Mediterranean pagan polytheism, Buddhism as criticism of Hinduism and so on) or within one religion (phenomena such as reform movements, fundamentalism etc.). Both, in intra-religious as well as inter-religious criticisms the frame of religion is not transcended. An explicit non-religious criticism of religion, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the history. It can be traced back to the European Age of Enlightenment. Nowadays, atheistic or even anti-religious voices have returned and the books by the so-called 'New atheists' (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett) are all bestsellers and were widely and vividly discussed. Both, the theses and arguments of the 'New atheists' as well as their public reception are examined in the course of a research project at the Free University of Berlin. Our project aims to analyze these two aspects in a historical comparison of the situation in Europe and the United States. By means of a discourse analysis, we hope to gain insights about the relations between what is called ―the return of religion‖ (Riesebrodt) and the return of the criticism of religion. At the 2009 NSRN our first findings will be presented. ",

		"text": "Methodological challenges in understanding different modes and locations of irreligiosity This paper demonstrates how to make use of existing survey data on religion when studying Atheism and irreligiosity. I shall suggest that it is useful to make a distinction between Atheism (as an identity tag) and general irreligiosity (for example indifference). This is especially so, because the current debate on New Atheism is dividing the irreligious: some identify themselves as atheists while others refuse to do so. Furthermore, it is helpful to study the phenomenon by not simply looking at beliefs but also identification, attitudes, participation, private practice and membership (including reflections on future membership). The importance of these distinctions lies in an attempt to construct a coherent picture of the varying modes and locations of Atheism and irreligiosity. It also may change the way the issue is dealt with more generally, because in public discourse these distinctions are often neglected. Although my research is focused on public discourse in Britain and Finland, in this example I will focus upon Finnish society. I shall suggest, however, that the methodological strategies can be applied to all societies where Western-style discourse on religion exists. Instead of simply attempting to explain the Finnish situation by referring to meaningful sociological variables such as education, gender, class, age and region, I shall combine the survey data – World Values Survey, Church Monitor and Gallup Ecclesiastica (1995–2005) – with systematically collected newspaper material to offer an interpretation of the Finnish situation. Two observations will be made: firstly, Finnish people are belonging (to religious organisations because of others) but not practising (themselves); secondly, they are rather irreligious (indifferent, non-religious) but not self-identifying Atheists. The connection between these two observations will be discussed. ",

		"text": "The good atheistic Samaritan: Intrinsic, extrinsic and quest atheism and its relationship with prosocial behaviour Contemporary psychological research concerning the relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour shows an ambiguous picture. Some researchers found a correlation between religiousness and helping behaviour (Bernt, 1989; Hansen, Vandenberg, & Patterson, 1995; Sappington & Baker, 1995) where others did not (Darley & Batson, 1973; Smith, Wheeler, & Diener, 1975; Sundeen & Raskoff, 1995). In studies documenting positive effects religiousness was frequently investigated with qualitative measures such as the intrinsic, extrinsic and quest religiosity scales proposed by Batson (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991). These scales are based on underlying constructs covering social activities, philosophical thinking, ritualistic behaviour and worldview scepticism practiced by atheists and theists alike. However, terms specifically associated with Christianity (e.g. church, prayer, bible) increase the item difficulty for atheists and generate variance in the theistic sample only. The study to be presented investigated the question whether religiosity scales measure theistic/ supernatural beliefs or rather social, cultural and philosophical activities. The results indicate that the supposed relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour is not based on theistic religiosity (i.e. belief in the existence of supernatural beings) but rather on sociocultural attitudes shared by theists and atheists.

		"text": "A British secular–religious cleavage? The growing visibility of secular commentators and organisations in Britain is often regarded as evidence of a cultural conflict between ‗the Secular' and 'the Religious'. Two key assumptions underlie this popular account: that there is growing disagreement between the two groups, and that each group is a homogenous actor that can be mobilised against the other. But are these assumptions supported in reality? For instance, can we meaningfully speak of a 'secular' camp on cultural issues? The paper answers these questions by examining whether the controversy we see in the media reflects a divide at the mass level. The analysis uses survey data to model distributional measures of public opinion over time (1983-2007). Two types of social attitudes are examined: positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relations. Results identify a widening gap between the non religious and the religious (esp. Anglicans) regarding attitudes towards homosexual relations. This widening gap is a function of the differential rate of liberalisation that has affected both groups. However, if the gap is to be consequential for social and political developments, each competing group should be growing increasingly homogenous. Findings suggest that there is no such trend in the internal coherence of the two groups. ",

		"text": "The challenge of popular religion to atheism: a socio-cognitive approach According to a recent British opinion poll, 64% (n=1000) believe that ‗some people have powers that cannot be explained by science', 49% believe in ghosts, and 41% believe in communication with the dead. Earlier Gorer (1955), in a survey conducted in an English newspaper, found equally robust levels of belief in ghosts, reincarnation and horoscopes. The ‗new age' or ‗holistic' milieu is similarly fecund (  2003, Heelas and Woodhead 2005). I argue that such qualitative evidence in the UK (for example) suggests that – despite apparent triumphs of secular modernity - religious belief and practice is alive and well in its popular, ‗theologically incorrect' (Barrett 1999/Slone 2004) expressions. These expressions support more complex, synthetic and/or discursive forms of ‗religion', making the articulation of ‗religion' in ordinary, everyday life settings appear unremarkable and ‗natural'. On this evidence, modernity and popular religion are not mutually exclusive, secularization has in-built limitations, and atheism – defined as predicating social identity on denial of god(s) - is likely to remain a pursuit of intellectual minorities. I argue that ‗folk' narratives and models are a better guide to what ‗religion' is like at the point of production than sophisticated and abstracted reflections produced by specially trained elites (whether religious or secular). They also point to the persistence and longevity of ‗religion' insofar as cognitive representations generated below the level of conscious awareness instinctively reinforce socially constructed discourses. The elementary forms of ‗religion' are thus co-produced by cognitive processes in human brains operating in synchronization with sociological forces of order and legitimation. Atheism is likely to find this popular double act hard to breach. ",

Supernatural agency detection in random visual noise Within the cognitive science of religion it has been suggested that belief in supernatural agents is ubiquitous because of its capacity to fit the human cognitive system. Specifically, Barrett (2004) has suggested that a hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD), alongside other cognitive tools such as Theory of Mind, mediates this belief. Due to the hypersensitivity of the agency detection device, it is prone to find agents in the environment, even when none are present. Why some individuals do not believe in supernatural agency despite presumably still having a HADD has, however, previously gone untested. The task set was to detect (1) when the stimulus was a degraded image, and (2) what the image was (free response). Data from these tasks provide information on controlled and automatic dispositional factors at work during agency detection. Preliminary results suggest that there is a significant difference in the types of agency and non-agency detected within the random stimuli. This was across the participant groups, however, and there was no significant difference between the two belief-groups regarding the frequency with which agency was detected. Significant differences between the two participant groups were found, however, when analysing levels of psychoticism, boundaries and empathy, highlighting potential confounding variables that may interfere with the study of agency detection in religious and non-religious participants.

		"text": "Atheism in post-socialist conditions: The examples of Slovenia and Croatia While the majority of countries in Western Europe have become more secular in recent times, most post-socialist countries have been undergoing a process of desecularization. The disintegration of the socialist regime in Yugoslavia, which functioned as a sort of secular civil religion, took place in a period of escalating intranational tensions, conflicts, and ethno-religious mythologies. Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina, the nations most involved in the military conflicts from 1991 to 1995, have undergone a marked desecularization on the societal, organizational, and individual levels. From some perspectives, it might appear that Slovenia is an exception to this trend, as its transition to independence did not trigger a desecularization factor or what Steve Bruce termed ―cultural defence‖. But nevertheless we can speak in all of these cases of the essentially altered social position of atheism. If it was privileged before, it is now affected by strengthened and emboldened church ideologies. We observe in both Slovenia and Croatia the re-emergence of certain traditional attitudes toward atheism, which Colin Cambell, in his Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, called Victorian prejudices (Cambell, 1974). For this reason, I have undertaken in recent years the empirical testing of the following theses that have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral, and; 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Church about educated Slovenians and Croatians are unsubstantiated. Especially in Slovenia, both ―conviced atheists‖ and ―natural atheists‖ show (according to their own statements) above-average happiness, above-average reflection on life, above-average moral rigour and are less distanced from various social minorities. The reasons for such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia and Croatia on the other. The dialectic relationship between these two phenomena justifies (once again) the conclusion that the sociology of religion must incorporate the sociology of non-religiosity/irreligion. ",

Given that these concepts and their associated fields of belief, practice and organization represent a counter-field of interest for scholars of religion, as well as an increasingly important arena in the politics of religion, we ignore them at our peril. I shall consider the conceptual and categorical relationship between the religious and the secular, the boundary which separates them, and the resources that are available in the study of religion for examining this relationship. In particular, I shall refer to three approaches: historical/conceptual, spatial/discursive, and cognitive/cultural. These are all tools for understanding more about how we see imagine, define, classify and represent religion and its other (whether we call that non-religion or the secular), tools that, once employed, might challenge the categories we use and the anxieties they induce. Furthermore, I will examine what happens around the boundary between the religious and the secular and make a case for a reconstitution of the object of the discipline of religious studies to include non-religion as well as religion.
