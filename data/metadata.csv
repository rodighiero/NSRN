'Believing in belonging': Researching belief without asking religious questions,Abby Day,University of Sussex,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A unique research method was designed to answer the question: 'What do people believe in nowadays and how do we find out?' This approach was the first in the sociology of Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives religion to research belief by asking non-religious questions of apparently non-religious people. My qualitative method, detailed here, produced data that led me to conclude that statements of religious affiliation are often expressions of 'believing in belonging', where people associate with religion to reinforce ethnic, familial, or other social identities.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Members of Atheist/Freethought/Secularist organizations in Germany and the United States,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I would like to contribute a paper documenting my current research on organized atheism in Germany and the United States. With my study, I set out to investigate the motives, experiences, and biographies of those who have become more or less active members of primarily politically oriented (rather than philosophical, academic, or congregational) atheist / freethought / secularist organizations. While focusing only on members of this particular type of organization, my aim has been to vary the members' characteristics with regard to their age, gender, duration of membership, degree of activism, and socio-religious background as much as possible. With respect to the latter aspect, I have conducted interviews with members of German IBKA (International League of Non-Religious and Atheists) and BfG (Bavarian Freethought Association) in generally atheistic Berlin, religiously mixed North Rhine Westphalia, and traditionally Catholic Bavaria, as well as with members of local chapters and affiliates of the U.S. organizations American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International in California, Minnesota, and Georgia. All in all, from the summer of 2007 until the summer of 2009, I have conducted more than sixty interviews At Oxford, I would like to briefly present the sampling method employed (both with respect to sampling organizations as well as sampling interviewees), the interviewing technique used, as well as some preliminary findings on who the members of this type of organizations are.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.

A secular mind,Jonathan A. Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Cognitive anthropologists argue that we can better answer enduring anthropological questions by utilizing the growing insights of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This belief is not wholly unjustified, as cognitive anthropologists have had some success in addressing the long-standing question of why religious beliefs and practices are so widespread in human populations, mostly in reference to universal cognitive biases. This success, however, raises another enduring anthropological question, that of how to best account for ―secularization.‖ If religious beliefs are so well supported by universal cognitive biases, whence secularization and atheism? In this presentation, I will argue that a cognitive approach can help answer one important element of the secularization debate, the question of whether or not particular socio-economic environments cause decreased levels of religious belief and commitment. I will present both qualitative and quantitative data from my fieldwork and survey research among non-theists in Western countries suggesting that particular socio-economic environments do indeed lower levels of religious belief and that this effect occurs through the impact of these environments on our cognitive mechanisms devoted to reasoning about social groups and about what representations to accept from others.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Theoretical and methodological resources for breaking open the secular and exploring the boundary between religion and non-religion,Kim Knott,University of Leeds,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The secular condition, secularism and the associated non-religious ideological categories of agnosticism and atheism have particular significance in contemporary Europe. Given that these concepts and their associated fields of belief, practice and organization represent a counter-field of interest for scholars of religion, as well as an increasingly important arena in the politics of religion, we ignore them at our peril. I shall consider the conceptual and categorical relationship between the religious and the secular, the boundary which separates them, and the resources that are available in the study of religion for examining this relationship. In particular, I shall refer to three approaches: historical/conceptual, spatial/discursive, and cognitive/cultural. These are all tools for understanding more about how we see imagine, define, classify and represent religion and its other (whether we call that non-religion or the secular), tools that, once employed, might challenge the categories we use and the anxieties they induce. Furthermore, I will examine what happens around the boundary between the religious and the secular and make a case for a reconstitution of the object of the discipline of religious studies to include non-religion as well as religion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Supernatural agency detection in random visual noise,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the cognitive science of religion it has been suggested that belief in supernatural agents is ubiquitous because of its capacity to fit the human cognitive system. Specifically, Barrett (2004) has suggested that a hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD), alongside other cognitive tools such as Theory of Mind, mediates this belief. Due to the hypersensitivity of the agency detection device, it is prone to find agents in the environment, even when none are present. Why some individuals do not believe in supernatural agency despite presumably still having a HADD has, however, previously gone untested. The task set was to detect (1) when the stimulus was a degraded image, and (2) what the image was (free response). Data from these tasks provide information on controlled and automatic dispositional factors at work during agency detection. Preliminary results suggest that there is a significant difference in the types of agency and non-agency detected within the random stimuli. This was across the participant groups, however, and there was no significant difference between the two belief-groups regarding the frequency with which agency was detected. Significant differences between the two participant groups were found, however, when analysing levels of psychoticism, boundaries and empathy, highlighting potential confounding variables that may interfere with the study of agency detection in religious and non-religious participants.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Atheism in post-socialist conditions: The examples of Slovenia and Croatia,Marjan Smrke,University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the majority of countries in Western Europe have become more secular in recent times, most post-socialist countries have been undergoing a process of desecularization. The disintegration of the socialist regime in Yugoslavia, which functioned as a sort of secular civil religion, took place in a period of escalating intranational tensions, conflicts, and ethno-religious mythologies. Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina, the nations most involved in the military conflicts from 1991 to 1995, have undergone a marked desecularization on the societal, organizational, and individual levels. From some perspectives, it might appear that Slovenia is an exception to this trend, as its transition to independence did not trigger a desecularization factor or what Steve Bruce termed ―cultural defence‖. But nevertheless we can speak in all of these cases of the essentially altered social position of atheism. If it was privileged before, it is now affected by strengthened and emboldened church ideologies. We observe in both Slovenia and Croatia the re-emergence of certain traditional attitudes toward atheism, which Colin Cambell, in his Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, called Victorian prejudices (Cambell, 1974). For this reason, I have undertaken in recent years the empirical testing of the following theses that have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral, and; 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Church about educated Slovenians and Croatians are unsubstantiated. Especially in Slovenia, both ―conviced atheists‖ and ―natural atheists‖ show (according to their own statements) above-average happiness, above-average reflection on life, above-average moral rigour and are less distanced from various social minorities. The reasons for such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia and Croatia on the other. The dialectic relationship between these two phenomena justifies (once again) the conclusion that the sociology of religion must incorporate the sociology of non-religiosity/irreligion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Belief in science and in the “Da Vinci Code”: Measuring naturalistic beliefs and its cognitive correlates,Miguel Farias,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper describes the development of a scale of naturalistic beliefs by the author of the paper, in collaboration with philosophers Guy Kahane and Nick Shackle, and the historian of science John Hedley Brooke. Preliminary validation of the scale was carried out with a sample of religious and atheist students (N = 130), that also filled in a number of other measures, including belief in ideas put forward in the best-selling ―Da Vinci Code‖ novel, knowledge of the Bible, and standardised cognitive and personality scales. I will present and discuss the newly developed scale on naturalistic beliefs as a way of tapping into contemporary atheists' ideas and attitudes, particularly related to the value attributed to science in understanding the world. I will also discuss some apparently contradictory evidence suggesting that atheists have higher scores both on ―need for cognition‖ and ―Da Vinci Code beliefs‖ than religious people.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Dimensions and types of non-religiosity: Scale development in progress,Nicholas Gibson,University of Cambridge,England,M,Claire White,University of Oxford,England,F,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"We are unaware of any scale or instrument that can be used to distinguish among types of non-religious individuals. Although various labels exist to describe non-religious and secular positions (such as atheist or agnostic), these are often misunderstood or misapplied by laypersons. Even where they are correctly used it is clear that—for example—atheists differ in their emotional responses to religion, their intellectual interest in religion, and their behavioural repertoire with regard to religious individuals and institutions. Rather than attempting to generate a typology from philosophical grounds we see merit in allowing a typology to emerge empirically, thus tapping nonreligiosity as it is lived. This paper will present data from a 24-item scale intended to capture dimensions of non-religiosity within a sample of 131 British adult subjects selfdescribing as atheists or agnostics. Four potential dimensions of non-religiosity emerging from factor analysis will be examined together with an exploration of potential types of non-religiosity that emerge from cluster analysis of subjects.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
"Christo-secular ambivalence in British security policy, 2001-2009",Stacey Gutkowski,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although secularism has recently become a site of analysis for international politics, it has as yet received little theoretical elaboration in the area of security studies. A new research programme is needed to further this end, one that is not merely a secondary addendum to the existing one on religion and security. This paper suggests some directions for that research agenda, that turns to examine how trajectories of secularization and non-religion in Britain impacted on security policy towards radical Islam between 2001-2009. It seems that a kind of Christo-secular ambivalence has afflicted British security policy, both in the case of threat perception and the management of risk. The paper offers demonstrative examples from the Iraq War and counter-terrorism policy.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
The challenge of popular religion to atheism: a socio-cognitive approach,Steven Sutcliffe,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a recent British opinion poll, 64% (n=1000) believe that ‗some people have powers that cannot be explained by science', 49% believe in ghosts, and 41% believe in communication with the dead. Earlier Gorer (1955), in a survey conducted in an English newspaper, found equally robust levels of belief in ghosts, reincarnation and horoscopes. The ‗new age' or ‗holistic' milieu is similarly fecund (Sutcliffe 2003, Heelas and Woodhead 2005). I argue that such qualitative evidence in the UK (for example) suggests that – despite apparent triumphs of secular modernity - religious belief and practice is alive and well in its popular, ‗theologically incorrect' (Barrett 1999/Slone 2004) expressions. These expressions support more complex, synthetic and/or discursive forms of ‗religion', making the articulation of ‗religion' in ordinary, everyday life settings appear unremarkable and ‗natural'. On this evidence, modernity and popular religion are not mutually exclusive, secularization has in-built limitations, and atheism – defined as predicating social identity on denial of god(s) - is likely to remain a pursuit of intellectual minorities. I argue that ‗folk' narratives and models are a better guide to what ‗religion' is like at the point of production than sophisticated and abstracted reflections produced by specially trained elites (whether religious or secular). They also point to the persistence and longevity of ‗religion' insofar as cognitive representations generated below the level of conscious awareness instinctively reinforce socially constructed discourses. The elementary forms of ‗religion' are thus co-produced by cognitive processes in human brains operating in synchronization with sociological forces of order and legitimation. Atheism is likely to find this popular double act hard to breach.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
A British secular–religious cleavage?,Stratos Patrikios,University of Strathclyde,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The growing visibility of secular commentators and organisations in Britain is often regarded as evidence of a cultural conflict between ‗the Secular' and 'the Religious'. Two key assumptions underlie this popular account: that there is growing disagreement between the two groups, and that each group is a homogenous actor that can be mobilised against the other. But are these assumptions supported in reality? For instance, can we meaningfully speak of a 'secular' camp on cultural issues? The paper answers these questions by examining whether the controversy we see in the media reflects a divide at the mass level. The analysis uses survey data to model distributional measures of public opinion over time (1983-2007). Two types of social attitudes are examined: positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relations. Results identify a widening gap between the non religious and the religious (esp. Anglicans) regarding attitudes towards homosexual relations. This widening gap is a function of the differential rate of liberalisation that has affected both groups. However, if the gap is to be consequential for social and political developments, each competing group should be growing increasingly homogenous. Findings suggest that there is no such trend in the internal coherence of the two groups.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
"The good atheistic Samaritan: Intrinsic, extrinsic and quest atheism and its relationship with prosocial behaviour",Sven Oelsner,University of Jena,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary psychological research concerning the relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour shows an ambiguous picture. Some researchers found a correlation between religiousness and helping behaviour (Bernt, 1989; Hansen, Vandenberg, & Patterson, 1995; Sappington & Baker, 1995) where others did not (Darley & Batson, 1973; Smith, Wheeler, & Diener, 1975; Sundeen & Raskoff, 1995). In studies documenting positive effects religiousness was frequently investigated with qualitative measures such as the intrinsic, extrinsic and quest religiosity scales proposed by Batson (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991). These scales are based on underlying constructs covering social activities, philosophical thinking, ritualistic behaviour and worldview scepticism practiced by atheists and theists alike. However, terms specifically associated with Christianity (e.g. church, prayer, bible) increase the item difficulty for atheists and generate variance in the theistic sample only. The study to be presented investigated the question whether religiosity scales measure theistic/ supernatural beliefs or rather social, cultural and philosophical activities. The results indicate that the supposed relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour is not based on theistic religiosity (i.e. belief in the existence of supernatural beings) but rather on sociocultural attitudes shared by theists and atheists.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Methodological challenges in understanding different modes and locations of irreligiosity,Teemu Taira,University of Leeds,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper demonstrates how to make use of existing survey data on religion when studying Atheism and irreligiosity. I shall suggest that it is useful to make a distinction between Atheism (as an identity tag) and general irreligiosity (for example indifference). This is especially so, because the current debate on New Atheism is dividing the irreligious: some identify themselves as atheists while others refuse to do so. Furthermore, it is helpful to study the phenomenon by not simply looking at beliefs but also identification, attitudes, participation, private practice and membership (including reflections on future membership). The importance of these distinctions lies in an attempt to construct a coherent picture of the varying modes and locations of Atheism and irreligiosity. It also may change the way the issue is dealt with more generally, because in public discourse these distinctions are often neglected. Although my research is focused on public discourse in Britain and Finland, in this example I will focus upon Finnish society. I shall suggest, however, that the methodological strategies can be applied to all societies where Western-style discourse on religion exists. Instead of simply attempting to explain the Finnish situation by referring to meaningful sociological variables such as education, gender, class, age and region, I shall combine the survey data – World Values Survey, Church Monitor and Gallup Ecclesiastica (1995–2005) – with systematically collected newspaper material to offer an interpretation of the Finnish situation. Two observations will be made: firstly, Finnish people are belonging (to religious organisations because of others) but not practising (themselves); secondly, they are rather irreligious (indifferent, non-religious) but not self-identifying Atheists. The connection between these two observations will be discussed.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
The 'return of religion' and the return of the criticism of religion: The 'New Atheism' in recent German and American culture,Thomas Zenk,Free University of Berlin,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Criticism of religion can be found throughout the ages, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. It appears that history of religions itself can be interpreted as continued criticisms of one religion against another (e.g. Christianity as criticism of Judaism and Mediterranean pagan polytheism, Buddhism as criticism of Hinduism and so on) or within one religion (phenomena such as reform movements, fundamentalism etc.). Both, in intra-religious as well as inter-religious criticisms the frame of religion is not transcended. An explicit non-religious criticism of religion, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the history. It can be traced back to the European Age of Enlightenment. Nowadays, atheistic or even anti-religious voices have returned and the books by the so-called 'New atheists' (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett) are all bestsellers and were widely and vividly discussed. Both, the theses and arguments of the 'New atheists' as well as their public reception are examined in the course of a research project at the Free University of Berlin. Our project aims to analyze these two aspects in a historical comparison of the situation in Europe and the United States. By means of a discourse analysis, we hope to gain insights about the relations between what is called ―the return of religion‖ (Riesebrodt) and the return of the criticism of religion. At the 2009 NSRN our first findings will be presented.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.

We need an interpretive method to allow us to analyse cross-culturally and compare what belief means to different people in different places at different times. Analysing belief holistically and organically helped me to resolve the 'census question' puzzle: why would so many non-religious people choose to claim a Christian identity on the UK census?

Religiosity (whether Muslim or Christian) marks a common ground in the Muslim-majority country. Deconversion from Islam and declaring oneself non-religious is both legally and socially highly problematic. My fieldwork in Cairo has been conducted among individuals that overwhelmingly know each other through the internet, and have formed discussion groups with like-minded individuals both on- and offline. These groups and meetings provide a space to speak freely about ideas that are normally off-limits among family, friends or colleagues. The research has focused both on the role the internet plays in forging a space for such exchanges, as well as the issues that are bound up with declaring oneself non-religious (opposition to rise of Islamism and religious pressures, concerns with modernity).My project has at its heart a normalisation of the common view of religion‟s role in the region, demonstrating that while religion is a powerful force in the Arab Middle East, its role is never uncontested.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.
.,Katie Aston,Goldsmiths College,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Scholarly understandings of the growth of secularism in the 20th century assumed the retreat of religion into the private sphere, yet an upsurge in public expressions of religious practice have been observed in recent years in which material culture and new technologies play a vital role (Morgan 2008, Keane 2008). Such developments compound the need for greater critical comprehension of lived experiences of secularism, as highlighted by leading scholars including Professor Linda Woodhead, at the AHRC Innovative Methods in the Study of Religion conference (2010; also Asad 2009, Cannell 2010). Accordingly I shall conduct the first ethnographic study of explicit public enactments and experiences of secularism and nonreligious values in the UK, interrogating contemporary notions of secularism and its entanglement with religious practice. I will focus on individuals and groups in Britain mobilising publicly around values of non-religion and secularism, exploring their ritual symbolism, verbal and visual language; I will document the range of emergent material forms, rituals and networks using visual ethnographic methods (Banks 1999, Pink 2001). Preliminary research into the 2008 “Atheist Bus Campaign”, initiated in direct response to religious advertising campaigns, highlighted the significance of visual and verbal non-religious performance, including advertising and networking locally and internationally through new media. I anticipate that many contemporary public expressions of non-religion area response to public religious expressions in a multi-religious context and draw on historically embedded Christian ideology (Cannell 2005).",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

The project covers the reception of apocalypse in various contexts from the early middle age until contemporary times. I am concerned with the apocalypse of the 20th and 21st century. As a literary scholar I meanly analyze fiction and to some extent film, but I also catch try to catch a glimpse of apocalyptic prophecy in science. In a postmodern context the concept of the end has changed fundamentally. There seem to be not just one end, but a plurality of possible ends: The End of history, the end of class struggle, the end of philosophy, the death of God, the end of religions, the end of Christianity and morals […], the end of the subject, the end of man, the end of the West, the end of Oedipus, the end of the earth, Apocalypse now […]”. (Derrida 1983). Some key questions concerning the “secularized apocalypse” are: In a secularized age thinking the end is not any more a practice restricted to religion. Scientific models dominate our picture of the end of the world. Wars, ecological disasters, and cosmic catastrophes have the power to destroy the world as we know it. In this context apocalypse becomes an umbrella term for many phenomena which all have in common a complete or near complete destruction of the world. In a biblical sense from this point a renewal of the world would happen. But is this the case in a secularized apocalypse? What happens after the Day X if there is no hope for an intervention from god? Is there still space for a vision of a new and better world or is it just the survival of some unlucky people in an unpleasant place which once had been our world?",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

Attention has been focused on the possible range of nonreligious outlooks, symbolic representations and political expressions.

I‟m using oral histories and autobiographies to reveal how people described their own loss of faith and the age at which this occurs. In the last ten years the social history of religion in Britain has been dominated by the idea that the 'religious crisis' of the 1960s marked a watershed in the dechristianisation of Britain. Historians have suggested a variety of causal explanations for this, however, atheist apostasy is not amongst them. My work shows that apostates dechristianised from the beginning of the century and unbelief spread in the non-elite population until it was able to find expression in public discourse during the social revolution of the 1960s. In the preceding decades there were atheistic sub-cultures such as radical politics or university education which allowed some to realise their unbelief, yet others rejected religion with little apparent external influence. Apostasy tended to occur during adolescence, so we must look to the influences on children that shape beliefs, such as parenting, peer attitudes, education and entertainment, to explain how atheist apostates came to reject religious socialisation.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

It struck me that an ethnography of humanism in the UK would be a good follow-on project, and that's exactly what I plan to do starting this January, when I begin ESRC-funded fieldwork on the British Humanist Association. Although I have yet to do sustained research on humanism, I am interested, at the methodological level, in several issues, such as how categories like "belief" figure differently (or not) than in research on Christians, and how the dynamic between individuals and institutions plays out within a movement that is driven by traditions of "free thinking."",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.
.,Patrick McKearney,University of Cambridge,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Stand-up is a popular part of mainstream British and Irish culture. Yet it is rarely noted that nonreligious viewpoints are frequently expressed in the regular ridicule of religion (atheism and secularism receive comparatively little attention). But this study found that religion is ridiculed in significantly different ways. My research looks at six comedianS: Eddy Izzard, Dara O‟Briain, Dylan Moran, Ricky Gervais, Stewart Lee and Marcus Brigstocke. The former three ridicule flaws in religious people. But crucially they also ridicule these traits in non-religious people. The ultimate target of their ridicule is distinction between the religious and non-religious. They laugh with those they ridicule. The latter three, by contrast, ridicule traits from a position of superiority. Their target is an outsider group that they distance themselves from. They do not sympathise with religious people but laugh at them. The evidence of this diversity adds empirical substance to postsecularist critiques and so undermines a common discourse that conceives of ridicule as a homogeneous form. The differences between these forms are essential to understanding the sociological implications of the ridicule of religion, particularly in poorly understood political events such as the Danish Cartoons.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

The basic goal of the chapter is to get a sense of what the ordinary, everyday lives of Nones are: what do they do instead of go to church, what are their hobbies, how do they derive their ethics and morals, how do they think about religious people, and how do they manager their non-religious identity in a predominantly religious society like the U.S. There have been a number of studies that have focused on Nones and seculars who are affiliated with pro-secular or pro-atheist groups, but nothing, to date, that focuses on nones without this connection, and particularly on their everyday lives.

.,Sarah Jane-Page,University of Nottingham,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I am currently developing a proposal to investigate the meanings and values around Christian festivals such as Christmas and Easter for those at the fringes of Christian belief (i.e. those willing to celebrate major Christian festivals but who would not participate in formal religion) and why these festivals carry such popular salience. One method I hope to utilise is video diary and video elicitation interviews. Basically, this will be a project seeking to identify the benefits people accrue through celebrating Christian festivals in a secular context, including a consideration of familial ties, nostalgia, consumerism and gendered work (such festivals involve a huge amount of planning and organisation, where traditional gendered divisions of labour may be reinscribed, despite increased egalitarianism in other spheres). It is thus focusing on religion and secularism at a cultural crossroads, where the religious and the secular are at an intersection or boundary, embedded in each other, but where politics of meaning are fraught and contested (Knott 2005). This is borne out by the Christian distaste of Christmas consumerism, often portrayed in outlets such as the "Church Times", or by the incongruence in popularity of Christmas carol services, where cathedrals and churches are filled to the brim with participants who may never set foot into a church at any other time of year. Although studies addressing the popular salience of Christian festivals in a secular context have been addressed in the United States (E.g.

Modes of Non-Religiosity,Johannes Quack,University of Heidelberg,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In academic no less than popular thought, India is frequently represented as the quintessential land of religion. Disenchanting India qualifies this representation through an analysis of the contemporary Indian rationalist organisations (those that affirm the values and attitudes of atheism, humanism or free-thinking).To understand the genesis of organised rationalism in India the book addresses the rationalists’ emphasis on maintaining links to atheism and materialism in ancient India and outlines their strong ties to the intellectual currents of modern European history. At the heart of Disenchanting India lies an ethnography of the organisation “Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti” (Organisation for the Eradication of Superstition) based in Maharashtra. This account describes the organization’s efforts to promote a scientific temper and combat the beliefs and practices it regards as superstitious. It also includes an analysis of rationalism in the day to day lives of its members and in relation to the organization’s controversial position within Indian society.The book outlines the distinguishing characteristics of this organisation through a depiction of the rationalists’ specific “mode of unbelief” in comparison to “modes of religiosity”. Alongside a critical engagement with the work of Max Weber and Charles Taylor, the theoretical discussion of modes of unbelief further provides an original basis for comparative studies of similar movements in a trans-cultural perspective. Finally, Disenchanting India can be situated within the contemporary debates about the nature of rationalism in Indian intellectual life and cultural politics. It thereby engages with debates that are as crucial for Anthropology and Religious Studies as they are for Post-colonial Studies, Sociology and History.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.,.
Atheism explained: The evolutionary origin of atheistic thought,Jonathan A. Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lanman argues that atheism – like religion in Boyer‟s account – is not an evolutionary byproduct. Instead, its distribution can be explained by „human-nature‟ (aspects of our evolved psychological make-up) in interaction with the socio-cultural contexts in which we live. Lanman guides us through this hypothesis. There is, he said, a large body of evidence against the idea that humans come to our understandings solely through a process of rational reflection. Instead, we see patterns in random occurrences; we often fall prey to our own confirmation bias, tending to look for evidence to confirm our views and rarely looking for evidence to disprove it. Rather, „rationality‟ is usually used to describe a normative vision of how we should think a view prevalent in contemporary Atheist and Humanist discourse. Yet rationalism fails as a general explanation for nonreligious normative stances, instead we need to look to socio-cultural. Lanman‟s ultimate view is that neither belief or non-belief are natural; we need to start from a view that our behaviour is mostly unconscious and our brains are wired to numerous specialisms which can be affected without damaging the overall intelligence or other specialist functions.",2011,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.
NSRN Glossary,Lois Lee,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Given that the core terminology for nonreligion often involves terms with allocated rather than intrinsic meaning (c.f. for example 'unreligion’, 'nonreligion’, 'areligion’), this glossary gives a guide to how such terms are used throughout this website. N.B. This terminology does not include definitions of religion, theism or other relative concepts. The argument is that being precise about different forms of contingency is useful in itself – and are meaningfully distinct regardless of how their NSRN Glossary contingent terms are understood. E.g. the concept of 'nonreligion’ is contingent on notions of 'religion’, which might be viewed as an analytic category or as a human construction or as both.

Secularity is then a term encompassing the religious-secular binary and built upon discourses and practices, which deploy this distinction.

Defining 'Atheism’: A Modest Proposal,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lois Lee’s draft glossary provides us which much – and valuable – food for thought. However with one definition, at least, I find myself in disagreement: Atheism – a conscious or unconsious lack of commitment to God(s) (2011: 2) Commitment strikes me as a problematic and ambiguous category. Is this a lack of intellectual commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of commitment to (the idea that there exists [a]) God(s)’ ? Or a lack of what one might term an existential commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of (personal, devoted, trusting?) commitment to God(s)’? The former might imply the latter, but the same is not true vice versa. It can be argued that while a great many Britons have at least some kind of intellectual commitment to the idea of God existing (even if this commitment extends only to ticking the requisite box on sociologists’ surveys), comparatively few have the kind of existential commitment to God(s), traditionally expressed through regular prayer, attendance at religious services, etc. This ambiguity could, of course, be clarified fairly satisfactorily. However, I believe a far better and usable definition of 'atheism’ – one already in scholarly use – can be located in the category not of 'commitment’, but of 'belief’. What I want to do in this short paper, then, is simply to outline what I believe to be a fairly uncontroversial definition of atheism already in scholarly use: 'a lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods’. While I will be presenting a case for the utility of this definition, I do not intend to do so in any exhaustive, defeat-all-comers way. All I am wanting to do is to put one (I think good) definition on the table, as a stimulus to discussion and debate.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.,.

Various institutions – the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CIA, the World Values Survey, Gallup, and many others – have performed sophisticated statistical analyses on cross-national data. The present investigation demonstrates that valid and reliable data concerning religiosity and secularity exist for most countries and that these data are comparable. Cross-national data relating to social, political, economic and cultural aspects of life were tested for correlation with religiosity/secularity. In contrast to the most widely accepted general account of secularity, the Existential Security Framework (ESF; Norris & Inglehart, 2004), secularity was not most highly related to material security, though these were highly related. Rather, secularity was most strongly related to the degree of formal education attained. Material security explained no significant variance beyond education. Thus, religion’s primary function in the world today is being replaced, not so much by the pseudo-materialistic supplication for better living conditions as posited by the ESF, but by contemporary education – extensive knowledge of contemporary cultures, philosophy, modes of thought or processes of reasoning.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.

However, much of this scholarship relies on two critical and largely unaddressed assumptions: (a) that when people report negative attitudes toward atheists, they do so because they are reacting specifically to their lack of belief in God; and (b) that survey questions asking about attitudes toward atheists as a group yield reliable information about biases against individual atheist targets. To test these assumptions, an online survey asked a probability-based random sample of American adults (N = 618) to evaluate a fellow research participant (“Jordan”). Jordan garnered significantly more negative evaluations when identified as an atheist than when described as religious or when religiosity was not mentioned. This effect did not differ as a function of labeling (“atheist” versus “no belief in God”), or the amount of individuating information provided about Jordan. These data suggest that both assumptions are tenable: nonbelief—rather than extraneous connotations of the word “atheist”—seems to underlie the effect, and participants exhibited a marked bias even when confronted with an otherwise attractive individual.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.

In this lecture, I address these questions by drawing on fieldwork among humanists in Britain, paying particular attention to humanism’s relation to Christianity. In one way or another, humanists often position themselves in relation to Christianity. In a basic way, this has to do with humanists’ commitment to secularism—the differentiation of church and state. In more complex ways, though, it also has to do with an effort to move “beyond” Christianity—to encourage a world in which reason takes the place of revelation—while often, at the same time, recognizing what’s worth saving and even fostering from the legacies of faith. All these various relations and perspectives suggest how we should understand social life in contemporary Britain as what it is in spite of Christianity—and not.",2012,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.
Irreligious Socialization? The Adult Religious Preferences of Individuals Raised with No Religion,Stephen M.

In addition, those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religious preference as adults. Despite their growing numbers, individuals raised with no religion have received little attention from scholars. The adult religious preferences of these individuals provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test theories of religion and social change. Using General Social Survey data, I examine the adult religious preferences and beliefs of individuals raised with no religion. I provide evidence of a shift in socialization and social influences experienced by those who report growing up with no religion. Compared with earlier cohorts raised with no religion, more recent cohorts have had more secular upbringings and tend to be more secular, liberal, and wary of organized religion as adults. They are also more likely to have a religiously unaffiliated spouse, if they marry at all. Results from a logistic regression analysis indicate that these trends explain much of the cohort differences in the likelihood of remaining unaffiliated as an adult.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.
The Sociology of Irreligion: Past and Present,Colin Campbell,University of York,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It would be wrong to suppose that irreligion is a creation of the twentieth century. Although we are accustomed to hearing the age we live in described as the 'secular age’ or the 'age of doubt’, previous periods of history could justifiably be similarly labelled. To the Christians of the time, the last years of the Roman Empire must have seemed a time in which scepticism and heresy flourished, just as to the orthodox Christian of the eighteenth century the rise of Deism and the French Revolution indicated that he was living in an 'age of infidelity’. Even the Middle Ages, frequently treated as the epitome or an era of faith, was seen by medieval writers as a time of spiritual crisis, in which witchcraft, heresy and paganism were constant threats to the faith. The principal reason why our perspective of history is such that we view our own time as characteristically irreligious and contrast it with what we believe to be the prevailing faith of all previous epochs is because we live in the shade of the late nineteenth century. And it is the religious activity of that period which we tend to use as the yardstick by which to measure our own lack of faith.",2013,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

Non-theists and theists as a whole, as well as theist subgroup assessments, were compared. Data were collected through self-report surveys. Additionally, to test moral decision-making abilities, participants answered questions based on situational dilemmas. Using Kohlberg’s coding schema, scores were assigned for the participant’s global moral reasoning rather than for the content of their answers. Using independent groups t-test, ANOVA, and post-hoc tests,our findings suggest no support for the existence of the stereotype that non-theists are less moral than theists.

Building Bridges in the Shadows of Steeples: Active Atheists and the Negotiation of Community and Identity in a Theistic Culture,Aislinn Addington,University of Kansas,Kansas,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Atheists are an ideological minority in the United States. Atheists who actively seek out like-minded others are even fewer and farther between. Based on 30 in-depth interviews with active atheists (atheists who participate in some type of secularly oriented club or organization), this paper explores the ways in which secular individuals construct and maintain community within an overwhelmingly theistic society. Findings suggest that boundary work in face-to-face community settings helps to crystallize individual and group identity as they navigate through a social world that, for the most part, disagrees with them. Like any ideological camp, the atheist movement, and the small organizations investigated in this study, encounter plenty of diverging opinions from inside their organizations as well. Additionally, this group utilizes new media and social networking online as a component of community as well as a platform for building and broadcasting identity. This paper begins the work of assessing if and how atheist use of online social networking affects their “real life” interactions with one another as well as with those who oppose their views. This paper not only contributes to an area of sociology that has long been neglected, it does so with data sourced directly from the population involved.

The Hypothetical God: Asking Nonbelievers to Imagine a Divine Figure,Alex Uzdavines,Case Western University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"As anyone who has played a good game of Dungeons and Dragons can attest, people are able to create detailed representations of entities they do not believe exist. While previous research suggests that nonbelievers are able to create images of divine figures, the content of these images had not been thoroughly investigated. We asked nonbelievers from the United States if they could form an image of a hypothetical divine figure. Of 520 participants, 81% were able to form an image of a divine figure. While images based on popular religious teachings were the most common, images based on previously held religious beliefs and other personal ideas were also reported. Participants then rated the characteristics of the hypothetical divine figure using the God-10, which measures the degree to which a divine figure is seen as cruel, distant, or loving. Compared to religious believers, nonbelievers described their imagined divine figures as somewhat crueler and substantially more distant and less loving. Participants later answered two questions about what they would say in an encounter with an imagined god and how this god would respond. Most participants did respond to these questions, and several themes emerged which paralleled the God-10 results. While many nonbelievers asked questions about the purpose of suffering and the god’s absence, there were few angry responses or accusations of sadism. These results show that nonbelievers can generate robust and informative images of a hypothetical god figure.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Organizational Variation in the Nonreligious Community,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With the rapid rise of religious non-affiliation in the United States over the past two decades, scholars have recently produced impressive work on the topic of nonreligion. However, little work has focused specifically on the role organized nonreligion plays in shaping a nonreligious identity, or the organizational variation that exists within the nonreligious community. How do different organizational types affect the development, maintenance, and salience of a nonreligious identity, and how might the individual and collective identities of members in turn affect organizational identity (i.e., the features that an organization is expected to possess)? My dissertation aims to uncover answers to these questions. I expect that a typology of nonreligious organizational identity can be developed, similar to the typologies of nonreligious individual identity currently being explored. This research will add to existing knowledge of nonreligion in the United States; American nonreligion is likely as diverse a phenomenon as American religion, and current research is only beginning to reflect this reality. I will investigate these topics using various qualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews with nonbelievers, which will include a significant sample of nonbelievers who are not involved with a nonreligious organization, in order to control for the actual effect of organizational membership on nonreligious identity.

This may be why Locke warned that atheism “dissolves all.” If we turn away from religion, some may worry that there remains no firm foundation for political authority. There is, in fact, a close connection between atheism and anarchism (see Fiala, 2013). Bakunin, for example, rejected both “God and the State.” However, in the contemporary world, secular political authority remains the best pragmatic mechanism for the development of nonreligion, since secular political systems defend the rights of nonbelievers. There is no denying, however, that the nonreligious standpoint is skeptical of unjustified authorities and traditions. This skepticism can easily extend toward skeptical critiques of traditional political affiliations. This presentation will discuss connections between nonreligion and cosmopolitan or anti-political (even anarchistic) ideas.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Shifts Along the American Religious-Secular Spectrum,Ariela Keysar,Trinity College,Connecticut,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper examines three dimensions of American religion--belonging, behavior and belief--by creating a single, unified scale of religiosity and testing it with the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) and the General Social Survey (GSS). It shows that certain combinations of those three variables are far more common than others, and demonstrates changes over time in the percentage of people belonging to each cluster, with a trend toward diminishing religiosity. The paper identifies socio-demographic and geographic factors that are associated with the religiosity cluster to which a person belongs. The paper examines the ability of the new scale to predict how people will answer questions on contentious societal issues, using belief in evolution as a case study. The most religious definitely reject human evolution while the most secular definitely believe in it.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.
Organized Atheism in the US and Abroad – A Typology of Members from the Freethought-Secularist Movement,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With this paper, I would like to present the main results from my research on members of atheist or secularist organizations in the United States and Germany. In a situation in which religious indifference and strict religiosity were shown to be growing simultaneously in the modern world, yet the phenomenon of convinced irreligion was largely ignored, I set out several years ago to answer the question: Who are the decided, committed, and organized atheists and what drives their activism in different socio-religious settings within Western societies? This research was completed in late 2013. The results are based on 58 qualitative in-depth interviews with members from local atheist organizations, which offer their members community as well as chances for participation in political activism and which are conceptualized as part of a broader freethoughtsecularist movement. Despite their highly diverse religious / nonreligious backgrounds and biographies, processes of joining, and strategies and degrees of activism, eight distinctive types of members were identified. These are based on recurring narrative and action patterns (“motives”). The motive of political conflict unites the “Political Fighter” and the “Indignant”, the motive of belonging unites the “Collectivist” and the “Alienated”, the motive 16 of philosophical and religious knowledge unites the “Intellectual Enlightener” and the “Silent Intellectual”, while finally the motive of identification with the organization is central to the “Dissociate” as well as to the “Euphoric”. These types show the face of organized atheism to be very diverse and to be much more than and different from the caricature of “militant atheists” that has dominated public perception of the movement in recent years (in much of whatever little notice it has received).",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
.,Caleb D. Spender,Azusa Pacific University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the heady days that followed the stunning success of The God Delusion, Letter to a Christian Nation, and the rest of the New Atheist works, it should come as little surprise that publishers determined that the moment was right to follow up these semiphilosophical works with the memoirs of atheists. For if, the reasoning seems to have gone, the reading public was ready to read strongly anti-religious works of the polemical type it stood to reason they would be interested in reading the stories of how people became atheists, especially in a book culture as saturated with memoirs as our own. But if the emergence of the atheist memoir is not that surprising, what is a little more surprising is the emergence of a whole new genre of spiritual autobiography, what I will call the “deconversion story,” in which the memoirist accounts for their loss of faith (usually in Christianity) in strikingly (and often self-consciously) parallel terms to the conversion narratives of that faith. So where one had come to Jesus before now one embraces atheism. Where there are a number of criticisms one might level against this structure (not least the rather strange instance of converting to a belief you don’t have) and against the New Atheist polemic more generally, these deconversion stories are particularly interesting given that so much of the New Atheist polemic (as noted by critics like David Bentley Hart and Terry Eagleton) is rooted in anecdotes and personal narratives rather than abstract argument. In addition to an engagement with the structural imperatives of the conversion narrative form, I argue recent discussions in cognitive science and psychology, especially debates about both memory and belief formation, may be helpful in understanding the form and especially the content of the deconversion narrative. In effect I suggest that these neurological axioms diagnose an etiology of one of the more perplexing trends in recent life writing about nonreligion: the degree to which conversion relies upon narratives of experience whereas deconversion seems to rely upon narratives of evidence.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Examining Low Religiousness Among University Students in Istanbul,Catherine Caldwell-Harris,Boston University,Massachusetts,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"College students in Istanbul are surrounded by considerable contradictions. The life-style of a cosmopolitan European city beckons, but family life frequently retains traditional values such as skepticism of western behaviors like dating. A key source of tension for young people is religion. Turkey has a history as a secular state, but religious political parties and culturally powerful groups like Gülen have grown in importance in recent decades. To learn more about religious attitudes among young adults in this rapidly changing region, we surveyed 200 students at Istanbul University. Students completed an Islamic version of the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS), along with personality measures. Using the ROS categories, 37% of students were high on both intrinsic and extrinsic subscales, 13% were extrinsic, 14% intrinsic, while 36% were low/nonreligious. This group responded 'disagree’ on average to most questions, thus rejecting statements such as Unless conditions are blocked, I fast in the month of Ramadan. In several recent western studies, possessing an analytical reasoning style was associated with atheism. We examined this using the Cognitive Reflections Test (CRT) and the Rational Experiential Inventory (REI). To obtain correct answers on the math problems of the CRT, respondents must inhibit responding with an intuitive but false answer. Correct answers on the CRT negatively correlated with ROS extrinsic orientation, r= -0.45. The REI sub-scores measuring Rational Engagement correlated with ROS extrinsic at r= -0.35, a new finding in the literature (our team previously found a trend in this direction with American college students). No relationships were found between religiousness and the broader autism phenotype (using the Autism Quotient) in contrast to several western studies. Interview data with a small number of students revealed multiple reasons for atheism and low religiousness, but a salient issue was perceived incompatibility between scientific theories (especially evolution) and religious teachings.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
"Michel Foucault, Religion & the Theatrical Work of Jerzy Grotowski",Catherine Christof,Loyola Marymount University,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper I will locate the work of Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski (1933 – 1999) in the context of Michel Foucault’s poststructuralist concepts, particularly those regarding the body, history and Christianity. I will investigate two plays within Grotowski’s Theatre of Productions phase to see if they indeed did manifest the boundary-defying exploration of ideological structures that Foucault’s inquiries offer to religious studies work. I will then delve more specifically into the use of what religious studies scholar Thomas Beaudoin calls a 'Foucaultian imperative’ in art, demonstrating that Grotowski’s work could be seen to manifest a new way of religious knowing through a secular realization of theatre art. I will use Foucault’s work through the traditions of religious studies scholars Jeremy Carrette and James Bernauer to challenge the place of the body in the understanding of religion. By using Foucault as an interpretive theoretical framework, religion and the body can be linked much more effectively. I will explore the impact and resonance of these ideas as they exist in the secular productions of Grotowski’s early theatre career. I will examine Grotowski’s art in light of these critiques, notably exploring Grotowski’s work in light of Carrette’s assessment of Foucault’s 'spiritual corporality.’ In so doing I will explore how the religious studies work on Foucault provides an interpretive lens through which to view these productions as a challenge to the boundaries and limits of spiritual experience. The secular form of theatre art can then be explored as a means of experiencing the sacred.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
"“I Know It When I See It:” Humanism, Secularism, and Religious Taxonomy",Charles Louis Richter,George Washington University,Washington,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Few outside the academic study of religion have thought very hard about how “religion” might be defined. If pressed, they may employ the same definition that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart used when he defined “hard-core pornography” in 1964: “I know it when I see it.” The tendency toward such an intuitive definition of religion opens the door to confusion in communication—and potentially in policy. For most Americans, the terms “religion” and “church,” when used to describe broader categories, retain Christian connotations of structure, belief, and practice. These connotations are retained when they attempt to describe—in terms of religion—“secular humanism” or other quasi-religious philosophies or movements. This paper argues that secular humanism is a disruptive concept that brings to light the normative quality of religious worldviews. This paper will examine how observers who “know it when they see it” have taxonomized secular humanism and other examples of non-religion/irreligion as religions. The inclusion since the 1920s of “humanism” in catalogues of religious movements shows an evolving response to the concept that shifts with the perceived prevalence of irreligion in society, as well as the relationship between religion, irreligion, and the state. The modern case study of the Sunday Assembly, a “godless church” that started in England in 2013 and has toured North America seeding new congregations, provides a useful example of how the criteria of belief, ritual, dogma, and community are employed by both critics and supporters of the movement to evaluate its religious/ irreligious/non-religious status.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Increasing Diversity in Emerging Non-religious Communities,Christopher Hassall,University of Leeds,England,M,Ian Bushfield,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary growth in non-religious populations has given rise to novel communities with unique perspectives on social issues. We describe a study of diversity within speakers at conferences organised by and attended by the atheist community. We analyse trends in diversity of 630 speakers, corresponding to 1223 speaking slots at 48 conferences conducted for the purpose of discussing or espousing non-religious views over the period 2003–2014. Diversity among speakers (defined using multivariate statistics in terms of the representation of women and non-white people) increased significantly over time during the period studied. This broadening participation may have arisen from interventions to address issues of representation or may simply reflect a generational shift in the demographics of the community. However, on-going problems with data collection and the imbalance in the social cost of identifying as non-religious between different social groups continue to impede efforts to reduce barriers to equality within this growing movement.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.

Believing and Belonging – or not?: Trends and Predictors of Religious Belief and Belonging in the United States,Darren Sherkat,Southern Illinois University,Illinois,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last two decades, religious scholars and pundits have increasingly argued that Europeans and Americans “believe, but don’t belong.” It is a comforting analysis for people with religious commitments, since it suggests that the rising proportion of people who don’t identify with religion, nonetheless believe in the Christian gods or the divine inspiration of Christian sacred texts. Yet, recent studies also show that belief in gods are also on the wane, and that more Americans reject the divine inspiration for Christian sacred texts. Further, many who do not believe are compelled to identify with religious groups or to participate in religious services, and this may well have been the norm in prior generations. In this paper, I use data from the 1984-2012 General Social Surveys to examine trends in believing and belonging. I focus on two measures of religious belief—non-theism and secular views of the Bible, and two measures of religious belonging—non-identification and less than yearly religious participation. I compare trends over time and across generations for (1) believing belongers; (2) believers who don’t belong; (3) non-believers who belong; and (4) people who don’t believe or belong. I estimate sets of multinomial logistic regression models to examine how patterns of belief and belonging are influences by demographic factors and childhood religious identification.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in God’s Existence: A Quantitative Approach,David F. Bradley,Case Western University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research exploring why some individuals do not believe in the existence of a god or gods has largely been theory-driven, drawing from psychoanalytical, cognitive, or evolutionary theories. This has left a fundamental gap in our understanding: What reasons do nonbelievers themselves give for their nonbelief? Drawing on previous studies, this project aimed to develop and provide initial validity testing of a measure to capture these reasons: the Reasons of Atheists/Agnostics for 8 Nonbelief in God’s Existence Scale (RANGES). Participants (N = 520) were adults drawn from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk worker database. An initial item pool was developed based on a review of relevant literature and responses to open-ended questions in prior studies. The item pool was refined based on feedback from several academic researchers and non-academics who write about nonbelief. Responses to the measure were subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed a ninefactor solution: Socialization-Past, Socialization-Current, Bad Experiences with Religion, Societal Concerns, Intellectual, God Relational, Emotional, Intuitive, and Agnostic. The obtained factors were subjected to initial validity testing across a number of variables, including attitudes toward God or religion and previous measures of nonreligious identity and doubt. Correlation and multiple regression generally supported the construct validity of the measure’s subscales. Nonbelievers endorsed Intellectual reasons most strongly, followed by Agnostic, Societal Concerns, and Intuitive reasons. God Relational, Bad Experiences with Religion, Emotional, and Socialization reasons for nonbelief were endorsed less strongly. These results can help inform our understanding of the structure of nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
"Your Wedding, Your Way: Personalized, Non-Religious Weddings through the Universal Life Church",Dusty Hoesly,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Major national news outlets such as The New York Times have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or weddings conducted under its auspices. According to my initial research findings, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them self-describe as non-religious, usually as agnostic, atheist, apathetic, secular, or spiritual. Similarly, they describe their weddings in non-religious terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most religious language. These secular or spiritual wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. Using original survey, interview, and participant observation data, this paper explores why “secular” people employ ULC-ordained ministers for their weddings, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as religious and secular can be coconstitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheist Exceptionalism: The Definition and Legality of Atheism under the First Amendment,Ethan G. Quillen,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For my Doctoral Thesis I employed a discursive analysis to the field of scholarly definitions of Atheism in order to alleviate the need to either define the term anew, or adopt a particular definition. This methodology granted me the freedom to see how individuals might shape their Atheist identities based upon the particular influences that have shaped the scholarly discourse on how the concept itself is defined. What this paper intends is a similar analysis, using the discursive method to interpret a judicial field in order to understand how the concept is addressed, defined, and given agency by means of legal limitations. In the 17 collection of worldwide political organizations, the United States is exceptional in the sense of its intricate legal system based upon a Constitution and its subsequent Amendments, as well as the Supreme Court’s position in overseeing and determining the legality of the citizenry’s religious actions in relation to that Constitution. As a discursive field, the decisions made by the court in regards to Atheism reveal to us an interesting perspective on how the concept is defined legally, especially in relation to its 'legality’ under the First Amendment’s two clauses concerning the disestablishment of a 'national religion’ and the free exercise granted the American citizenry. This paper will discuss this 'legality’ across three case studies—public education, oath requirements, and public displays—in order to see how certain decisions by the Court have offered both a judicial definition of Atheism, as well as where this definition places Atheism—and Atheists—within the American Civil Religion.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Looking for a 'God-Shaped Hole’: The Political Dimensions of Religiosity and Anti-Atheist Attitudes,Evan Stewart,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The current literature on negative attitudes towards atheists reports many Americans carry cultural prejudice, seeing them as immoral, cynical, and hedonistic, and that individuals with high levels of religiosity are more likely to hold these kinds of biases. That story may be too simple, though, because we do not know what kinds of religiosity are associated with these attitudes. Existing literature on the topic often mixes indicators of distinct religious constructs or narrowly chooses indicators of only one type of religiosity. Using a combination of structural equation and ordered logit modeling with 2014 survey data from The American Mosaic Project, this paper demonstrates that high religious centrality—a personal identity favoring the integration of faith with other roles in public life—is distinctly and significantly associated with both public and private distrust of atheists unlike other forms of frequent religious participation or high religious orthodoxy. This centrality also has a strong Christian component and is explicitly political. It is expressed in relationships among survey questions probing respondents’ personal religiosity and their expectation that good citizens and competent leaders will be both Christian and religious, respectively. Substantively, these results lend support for a theoretical account of citizenship which incorporates a critical approach to studying dominant cultural forms of religiosity in the United States. They also suggest that it is methodologically prudent to carefully distinguish respondents’ constructs of religiosity when attempting to explain negative attitudes towards religious and non-religious minority groups.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Nones Shall Always Be with Us: Toward an Historical Perspective on Unbelief in America,Gordon J. Melton,Baylor University,Texas,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The years of the 21st century have been marked by the heightened visibility of the American community of Unbelief (atheists, humanists, freethinkers), a growth of Christian antiatheist rhetoric led by periodic papal pronouncements, and the most recent discovery of a seemingly growing community of “nones,” people variously defined as disassociated from any religious community and/or lacking any religious preference/ identity, which has led at times to the nones being identified with the community of Unbelief in things religious or supernatural. Reflection on this state of affairs is provided by an assemblage of two sets of data. First, the historical data on religious affiliation in America through the 19th and early 20th centuries indicates that the “nones” provided a far greater percentage of the population, being the majority in the decades prior to World War II. Simultaneously, unbelief, first manifest at the end of the 18th century as deism, survived and grew through the 19th century as freethought and through the 20thcentury in a variety of movements—Ethical Culture, Marxism, atheism, and Humanism. By 1940, some 4 to 5 percent of the population identified themselves as non-theists. Projecting the historical trends into the future, the Unbelief community has grown substantially through the last half of the twentieth century to the present, though it remains as the same 4 to five percent of the population (12 to 15 million. In that time, however, it has developed more than a half-dozen national organizations, each with local communities scattered across the continent, an organized base that provides the potential of substantial growth in the next generation.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Belonging without Believing: Secular Functions of Churches in Northern Europe,Isabella Kasselstrand,Colorado Mesa University,Colorado,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Levels of religious beliefs, practices, and identification are at the center of the current debate on European secularization. Grace Davie (e.g. 1990; 2002) argues that Europeans believe without belonging, referring to high levels of individualized understandings of the supernatural, while active participation is low. In contrast, I argue that attendance alone offers a limited understanding of religious belonging, and that many Northern Europeans, particularly Scandinavians, belong without believing, in that they support and indentify with latent, secular functions of churches while they no longer believe. This study uses a mixedmethods approach comprised of in-depth interviews as well as quantitative data from the International Social Survey Program and the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey. While figures of religious belief and belonging are frequently presented in the literature, few explain and highlight such findings with qualitative data. Scotland and Sweden were chosen as two comparative case studies from the relatively secularized Northern Europe. Findings reveal that a majority of Swedes are culturally religious (e.g. Zuckerman, 2008) as they do not believe but still identify with the Church of Sweden, which serves a largely secular purpose as part of a cultural heritage and as a provider of life cycle ceremonies. In Scotland, on the other hand, belonging without believing is more closely associated with a sense of community or cultural defense (e.g. Bruce, 2002) in a nation that is more religiously diverse. The findings ultimately draw attention to the importance of context and conceptualization in the study of distinct and multidimensional processes of secularization.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheist Churches: All of the Community with “None” of the Theology,Jacqui Frost,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Many have shown that religious involvement is one of the most common gateways into other forms of civic and community involvement in America, with the church being both a physical and ideological anchor around which community and morality are built. As younger cohorts are associating with organized religion less and less, many fear that America is in a “crisis of community” in which an increase in individualism and a decrease in religious affiliation has led to a decline in group membership and social networks, which in turn has led to a decline in reciprocity and trust amongst Americans. However, instead of retreating from community involvement, a large portion of these “nones” are instead forming their own voluntary associations, even churches, in response to a lack of secular outlets for community and civic engagement. This research is an ethnographic exploration of one of these communities - The Sunday Assembly. Founded in 2013 and dubbed an “atheist church” by the media, this group expects to have 100 “assemblies” worldwide by the end of 2014. Through in-depth interviews with organizers and members of one smaller, local group, as well as participant observation at their gatherings, I explore how this group is both copying and re-molding the church model in order to build a secular community around bettering themselves and their communities without invoking religious ideologies, in many ways complicating the crisis of community thesis. I will detail key findings from the first eight months of observations and interviews, fleshing out how one assembly is navigating their way through the logistics of becoming an organization while simultaneously fostering an emotionally and socially engaged community.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Politics of Secularism and the Paradox of a ChristianAmerican Ethos,Jeffrey Murico,San Diego State University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper analyzes the presence of secularization debates in the political arena in order to reveal a prevalent paradoxical Christian-American ethos. In short, this paper argues that those who are concerned with the encroachment of “secularism” are themselves secularizing various aspects of “religion” when engaging in the political process. Citing multiple examples, but focusing on one case study in more depth – the Mount Soledad Cross controversy - this paper argues that in each of these cases, those who seek to defend “the religious” from the threat of “secularism” are ultimately the ones doing the secularizing. Since 1913, some form of a cross has stood in the center of a public city park atop Mount Soledad in San Diego, California despite efforts by separationists to remove it who claim that its existence and maintenance is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Defenders of the cross argue that its existence on public land is Constitutional because the cross is not a religious symbol. Rather, they argue that the cross should be understood as a secular symbol – one that represents American identity, patriotism, and military service. This particular approach, I argue, is representative of a wider, paradoxical Christian-American ethos where “defenders of Christianity” resort to secularizing “the religious” as an attempt to preserve what they hold to be sacred. In order to preserve the cross in its current location, appellants are arguing that the cross has been divested of its religious meaning. In the end, such tactics contribute to, rather than defend against, the secularization process.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Transformations of Self and Society in Modern Egypt,Jeffrey T. Kenney,DePauw University,Indiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to measures such as the World Values Survey, Muslim-majority nations like Egypt constitute the most religious, and thus the least secularized, regions of the globe. Voices of atheism can be heard in Egypt, and they are becoming more forceful, but they are rare and draw attention more for their novelty than their social and political significance. Indeed, rational discussions about secularism/secularization in Egypt have been made difficult by an array of factors: the legacy of Western colonialism, authoritarian politics, a forceful Islamist opposition, and ongoing cultural debates about modern identity and authenticity. But signs of liberalism are evident in the emerging consumer culture. Egyptians are coming to see themselves, and express their identities, like many others around the world: in terms of class and the power to consume. And this trend has opened up the possibility for what one author has termed “cultural extroversion”—the capacity of Muslims to interpret lifestyle choice as coincident with religion. My presentation will explore the growing trend in self-help and personal development literature in Egypt, situating it within the demands of global capitalism and the psychological values of the enterprising self. Self-help, whether in Egypt or the US, legitimizes a turn inward, to explore and nurture the true self—a self often portrayed as hidden or suppressed by the dictates of traditional mores. The result of such self-exploration is not a rejection of Islam as much as it is its transvaluation: envisioning Muhammad as the Muslim Dale Carnegie or Allah as life coach. Through an analysis of selfhelp literature, I will analyze how the inroad of capitalism in Egypt is reshaping notions of the self, away from traditional Islamic notions to a self more in line with global capitalist culture.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Desacralization of the Middle-East: A Hybrid Theory of Secularization Exploring Levels of Religiosity in PostKhomeini Iran,Jeremiah Bowden,Claremont Graduate University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The theory of secularization, as it has been inherited in the West, adheres to a narrative of history as progress. Sociologists from Max Weber and Emile Durkheim to modern theorists such as Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson have argued that as societies modernize there is a dramatic decline in religious adherence, authority, and influence. Alternative models, which stress the centrality of free-markets and the inverse correlation between existential security and religiosity, are posited to explain the exceptional position of modern societies that remain highly religious. The pages that follow apply the theories above in order to elucidate the process of secularization in the Iranian context. Two questions are germane to this task: 1.) How has Khomeini’s Islamic Revolution, the quintessential example of political Islam, led to the demise of Islamist tendencies in Iran and 2.) Why does Iran, although modern in many regards, continue to be highly religious.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

Parallels and differences between religious and irreligious congregational and identity work, as well as the interactional, moral, symbolic, and cultural details of the proactive construction and celebration of godless worldviews through congregational activity will be explored.

Religious Nones in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Similar to many other modern Western nations, religious nones are growing rapidly in Canada. Religious nones represent onequarter of Canadian adults and one-third of Canadian teens today yet little is known empirically about this group in the Canadian context. Drawing on thirty interviews with religious nones, this paper explores some of the perceived benefits for identifying as a religious none, their beliefs about the supernatural, about meaning and purpose in life as well as the afterlife, about morality, and their aversion to religion that is forced on to others. Amidst their varied views on the supernatural and the afterlife, overall most religious nones believe that they are free and openminded relative to those who are deeply religious, they believe that they have meaning and purpose in life, they reject the assertion that humans need religion to be moral, and they adamantly oppose those who force their religion on to others – and this includes religious nones who do not believe that they ought to convince others to also become religious nones. In total these findings resonate with a pervasive and growing Canadian secular ethos that rejects exclusive belief systems, prides itself on the stance that religion is an individual and private matter, and opposes forcing one’s beliefs on to another – all in the name of protecting cultural ideals of diversity, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Polysecularity and Types of Nonbelief: Framing the Field of Secular Studies,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The affirmative commitments of nonreligious people leave them generally uninterested in personal religiosity, and keep them at relative distance apart from organized religions. This nonreligiosity is poorly characterized in terms of some “religious deficit” model, as if nonreligiosity should be framed by cognitive/ affective disabilities to be religious (e.g. a deficit in mentalization or theory of mind). Nor should nonreligiosity be framed in terms of any “religious aversion” model, supposing that the nonreligious person suffers from compulsive aversions to religion’s communal, compliance, or character demands. The establishment and development of Secular Studies has been obstructed by theological stereotypes for the nonreligious: the 'secular’ involves insensitivity or impassivity to religious wonders, or secularity is the realm of rudely materialistic and utilitarian matters, or secularity may be a manifestation of 'anti-religious’ antagonisms. Fair research into the thoughts and motives of nonreligious people should instead begin with them in their own lived worlds, not just contrasted against idealized theological portraits of religious people in theirs. Secularity should no longer be conceptualized solely in terms of regrettable deviations from hegemonic theological norms. The enjoyment of rewarding worldly pursuits, the concern for sound social relationships, and the engagement with important civic issues are prominent modes of functional secular living displayed across historical time periods and civilizations. I have labeled this broadly historical and global phenomenon as 'polysecularity’, suitable for multidisciplinary investigation. The world’s highways are not all roads going away from Rome; worldly pursuits are not all flights heading away from religion.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Religious Actions Speak Louder than Words: Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs) Predicts Theism and Non-theism,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,Michael Buhrmester,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A central claim of the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that pan-human cognitive mechanisms explain supernatural agent beliefs. This claim faces the challenge of accounting for nontheism. More precisely, if nearly all human beings possess the cognitive mechanisms outlined by CSR scholars, then how do we explain patterns in the presence of theists and non-theists? Evolutionary anthropologist Joseph Henrich has proposed the existence of a psychological bias focused on “Credibility Enhancing Displays” (CREDs). We are biased, Henrich argues, to believe the representations we receive from others to the extent that they 'walk the walk’ and not just 'talk the talk’. The implication for theism and non-theism is that individuals will be much less likely to acquire the theistic beliefs of their communities if they are not exposed to sufficient levels of CREDs. We will present new evidence from a diverse sample of Americans suggesting that CREDs exposure, as measured by our recently validated scale (alpha= .92), predicts theism vs. non-theism (B= .519, p< .01), all while controlling for religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for theism. They suggest that actions do indeed speak louder than words in convincing individuals of the reality of supernatural agents and that, to be successfully transmitted, religious commitments must be embodied.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Navigating the Nonbeliever Constellation: What’s at Stake in Labeling Nonbelievers and Secular Activists?,Joseph Blankholm,Columbia University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent articles from J.M. Smith (2011, 2013), LeDrew (2013), Cimino and Smith (2007, 2011, 2012), and Guenther et al. (2013) point both directly and indirectly to the need for a dialogue on how to describe America’s “nonbelievers.” Cragun and Hammer (2011) have provided sage advice for avoiding tacit pro-religiosity, though much discussion remains. Namely, should scholars treat humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, naturalists, and non-theists as a single group, and how carefully should they attend to the particularities ascribed to these terms by those who adopt them? This paper relies on 65 in-depth interviews with the leaders and members of America’s major nonbeliever organizations in order to provide concrete examples of how leaders from various types of groups understand their own labels and those of others. Because there is no consensus among these leaders, I couch my analysis within their interorganizational politics, and I observe the ways in which they both emphasize and minimize differences among the terms depending on the context. I then look at how scholars in our burgeoning field have chosen to describe these various groups, with the aim of offering some tentative suggestions on how to attend to the differences between them while still making use of efficacious umbrella categories. My hope is to spur a dialogue among those in attendance that I believe would be as helpful for others’ research and writing as I am certain it would be for my own.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

"If Given Clear Evidence for the Existence of a God, How Do Atheists and Agnostics Think They Would Respond?",Julie J. Exline,Case Western University,Ohio,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How do atheists and agnostics imagine that they would respond in two hypothetical situations: 1) being presented with clear evidence that a god actually did exist and 2) encountering this god, with a choice to approach, stand still, or move away? Adult participants (N = 520) from the U.S. completed an online survey via Amazon’s MTurk. Only those who endorsed nonbelief in any god on a screening question completed the survey. Results suggested that nonbelievers varied considerably in their imagined responses to god-focused evidence and encounters. On Likert items (consolidated through factor analysis), confusion was endorsed most, then fear, a loss of freedom, and positive emotion (these three did not differ), then anger, then guilt/ shame. An open-ended item revealed responses not tapped in the Likert items, including shock/surprise, continued skepticism, curiosity, awe, and decisions about whether to follow the god and whether/how to change one’s life and beliefs. In terms of the imagined encounter, most participants reported preferences to approach or stand still vs. moving away. In comparison to agnostics, atheists (especially “closed” atheists) imagined more negatively valenced responses (e.g., more anger, more loss of freedom, less positive emotion, less approach behavior, and more avoidance). In general, more positively valenced emotions and behaviors were associated with greater age, higher agreeableness and conscientiousness, lower neuroticism, more positive ratings of the (hypothetical) god’s attributes, more struggles involving religious doubts, less certainty about one’s nonbelief, fewer interpersonal struggles around religion, and fewer microaggressions related to one’s nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular Students and Spirituality,Kathleen M. Goodman,Miami University,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within higher education and student affairs, it has become very common to provide programming related to “spirituality” of college students, based on the premise that everyone is spiritual. Using data from a national study of college student spirituality conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute, I will investigate to the extent to which the concepts of spirituality as defined in the study are applicable to secular students in the sample. The original study, conducted from 2003-2007 used principle components analysis to identify factors related to spirituality, religion, and related qualities (which they defined as charitable involvement, ethical involvement, etc.). A major conclusion from the study was that today’s college students have very high levels of spiritual interest and involvement. My study seeks to understand whether that holds true for secular students. Preliminary findings suggest that secular students score lower than the overall sample on measures of spirituality and religion, but they score only slightly lower on the related qualities measures. I conclude that many of the topics called “spirituality” are salient for secular students, however, the concept is not universally applicable. A practical implication based on these findings is that educators should begin with the broad concept of “Pathways to Purpose,” or “Purpose, Meaning, and Values” (rather than defining that as spirituality) to create a more inclusive environment. Framing programming in this way will broaden conversations so students can position themselves in the conversation in ways that are authentic to them, whether they are spiritual, religious, secular, or some combination.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Nonreligion and Religious Pluralism in Australia: A New Context for Christian Identity and Dialogue,Kevin Lenehan,Catholic Theological College,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"By all indicators, Australia is among the most nonreligious nations on earth, rated 10th by the WIN-Gallup 2012 Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. In this paper I will firstly outline religious/nonreligious identification in Australia on the basis of the 2011 national census data. A comparison with earlier data shows a steady decrease in identification with Christian churches other than Roman Catholicism, a small but steady increase in identification with religions other than Christianity, and a consistent increase in the number of Australians identifying as 'no religion’ (22.5% in 2011). In the second section of the paper, I will look beyond the statistics of institutional identification to explore social research into the beliefs and practices Australians use to make sense of life. This perspective calls for a more nuanced description of religious/nonreligious identity than data such as a national census can provide. In the Australian context, as well as intentional religious and nonreligious identification we find evidence of high levels of both 'believing without belonging’ and 'belonging without believing’, within a pragmatic cultural attitude of 'practical secularity’. This situation is reminiscent of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s analysis of his own 1940s European context, a 15 post-Christendom culture in which people lived and acted 'as though God does not exist’. In the third section of the paper, I will draw on Bonhoeffer’s challenging insights about what the Christian church can learn from the 'promising godlessness’ of its contemporaries to propose some characteristics of the kind of dialogue Christians are called to in Australia’s pluralistic context.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
How Christian Atheists Can Shed Light on Anti-Atheist Prejudice in America,Kyle Thompson,Claremont Graduate University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Anti-atheist prejudice in the United States is well documented in both academic studies and in news media yet its underlying causes are still not fully known. Since data suggests that atheists experience prejudice in different ways and for different reasons than other more prominent types of discrimination, such as racial prejudice, the process of understanding anti-atheist prejudice likely requires unique research and critical thinking. In this essay, I will explore possible explanations for anti-atheist prejudice based on the most comprehensive scientific examinations of atheists as well as propose that social scientists study Christian atheists, people who lack a belief in God but subscribe to the moral teachings of Jesus, to see if they experience the same degree of prejudice and stereotyping as other atheists. While sociological data indicates that much of the negative stereotyping surrounding atheism results from concerns about an atheist’s ability to behave morally, it is not clear precisely what causes this moral distrust since atheists tend to not only lack a belief in any supernatural moral scorekeeper, but also any universal and codified set of ethical norms such as those found in religious texts. Since Christian atheists affirm the set of ethical norms of Christianity while lacking a belief in God, it would be highly useful to investigate whether people hold the same stereotypical view of them as they do atheists who do not self-identity as Christian atheists.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
"Religious Markets, Regimes, and Secularity: A Comparative Study",Linda Lockett,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,F,Ted G. Jelen,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, we present three models of religion/regime relations. The “Quasi-Establishment” model describes nations with pluralistic religious markets, in which explicitly religious alternatives seek social and political advantages. Nations which embody the ancien regime model have a dominant religious tradition, which has been discredited through association with a previously undemocratic regime. Finally, National Identity regimes consist of nations in which a particular religious affiliation is a component of national identity, and in which this link has been defined by the actions of an outside power. We hypothesize that the correlations of religious non-affiliation will be different in each regime type. In religiously pluralistic societies, non-affiliation will largely be caused by individual characteristics, such as education and education. In nations that embody the ancient regime model, religious non-affiliation will be positively related to indicators of secular social integration, such as participation in voluntary associations, partisan identification, etc. Conversely, religious non-affiliation will be negatively related to social integration in national identity regimes. Data for this study will be taken from the World Values Surveys, with two cases for each regime type. We will consider India and Brazil to be examples of the Quasiestablishment model, Chile and Turkey as instances of the ancient regime model, and Poland and Iran as national identity exemplars.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular or Nonreligious? Profiling and Theorising European and US 'Religious Landscapes’,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In profiling religiosity, Europe and the US are almost always described as different: 'secular Europe’ and 'religious America’. This paper presents quantitative data that show that the secular population (i.e. the number of people who are more or less indifferent to religion) is consistent not only across European countries but is also of a similar scale in Europe and the US. On the other hand, the size of the active nonreligious population varies, between these countries and continents. Thus, secularity appears to be less significant for understanding differences between the European and US 'religious landscapes’ than active participation in religious and nonreligious cultures: several European countries appear to have vital nonreligious cultures with established histories, whilst this is an emerging phenomenon in the US. I argue therefore that the study of nonreligion as distinct from secularity is fundamental to progressing understanding of contemporary societies and theorising their causes and development.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
In the Name of a Draconian Conception of State Neutrality’: Law’s Affirmation that You Can’t be Good without God,Lori Beaman,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The legal regulation of religion extends beyond categories of religion to the emerging category of nones. Most famously, the Lautsi decision in Italy highlighted the tensions that emerge between historically dominant religious hegemonies and those whose lives are not informed by religious worldviews. And yet, the European Court of Human Rights entertained the notion that dominant religion is not necessarily religion per se, but represents universal and cultural values which inform and indeed benefit all of society. Contrary to the argument of atheists that one can be good without god, legal discourse is shaping a new rhetoric of the foundational nature of religion to the common good, an idea that presses even those who do not 'believe’ to believe, or to at least accept the inherent value of god in the creation of a good society. The universal truth of religion becomes, then, inescapable and impossible to opt out of. This new legal rhetoric has increasing traction in a number of western democracies whose majoritarian religion would seem to be in decline. Law is coming to the rescue, carving out a new place for religion as fundamental to societal well-being and religious practices and symbols in state institutions are therefore an acceptable and even welcome presence. This talk will explore these issues in light of the Saguenay case that is now before the Supreme Court of Canada.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
What Happens in Vegas is... Moral Embattlement: Irreligious Moral Performance as Cultural Resistance in Sin City,Lori L. Fazzino,University of Nevada,Nevada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Labeling atheists as immoral individuals, the very personification of evil, is not a particularly new idea. Attaining civic inclusion in a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, a city like Las Vegas where God is believed to be absent, would be easy. This is simply not the case. The strong cultural lore of “Sin City” promotes a false illusion that Las Vegas is a city where vice trumps virtue for sinners rather than saints. In this paper, I take a qualitative ethnographic approach that integrates participant observation, visual data, and in-depth interviews with textual analysis of local news stories. My goal is to understand how atheists have engaged in community building, activism, and collective boundary work in Las Vegas. My findings suggest that the moral landscape of Las Vegas very much a terrain of resistance where the interplay between religious and secular ideologies create a contested web of power and counter-power relations, indicating that even in Las Vegas where it is acceptable to be a sinner, heathens are persona non grata. I argue that the mobilization of collective action among the Las Vegas humanists and atheists community should be understood as dramaturgical performances of irreligious morality that both justifies the rejection of deviant labels and challenges the moral proclivity of American theists. The implications of these findings center on larger issues concerning atheist visibility, which I contend is a cultural expression of resistance, not only in “Sin City”, but in the United States as a whole",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Ninety-Eight Atheists: Atheism among the Non-Elite in Twentieth Century Britain,Matt Sheard,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Widespread atheism in the general population is one of the defining characteristics of twentieth-century British society, yet until very recently, it has largely been unregarded by historians. This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced 'irreligious socialisation’, rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12–18% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as 'unarticulated causes’ of the subjects’ irreligion.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.
"The Rise of the Nones: Politics, Spirituality, and Neo-Secularization",Matthew Brake,George Mason University,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The United States has traditionally been a “churched” nation and has often been cited by desecularization theorists as an indicator of the flawed nature of the secularization thesis; however, in the past decade, the U.S. has seen a rise of those identifying themselves as having no religious affiliation. These so-called religious “nones” have caused some debate about the future of religion in the U.S. Are there any societal reasons for this increase? Does the rise of the religious nones indicate a decline of religious belief in the United States? Does this trend give validity to the secularization thesis? In this paper, I will first evaluate the reasons for the rise of the religious nones in light of considerations from José Casanova’s article, “Rethinking Secularization: A Global Comparative Perspective.” In dialogue with Casanova, I will compare the relationship between state/ church politics and the secularization of Europe with the relationship between state/politics politics and the rise of the nones in the United States. Next, I will consider the religious make-up of the religious nones with particular attention paid to the presence of any private spirituality among this group. Appropriating the work of Rodney Stark, I will consider whether the persistence of spirituality among the nones constitutes an effective rebuttal of the secularization thesis. Finally, I will consider the work of Mark Chaves and consider whether or not neo-secularization is an adequate concept for understanding the phenomenon of the religious nones in the United States.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular Cooperation in England and the Americas,Michael Rectenwald,New York University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, I treat Secularism as founded by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851-52. In particular, I focus on the distinction that Holyoake maintained over the course of fifty years regarding his branch of Secularism, in the face of the broader, arguably more successful division of the movement led by Charles Bradlaugh. As distinct from Bradlaugh, for Holyoake the “secular” did not primarily signify the absence or negation of religious belief or practice. Rather, by the secular, Holyoake indicated a substantive category in its own right. Secularism itself represented a “positive” creed and movement intended to supersede or superintend both theism and atheism. Holyoake imagined and fostered the co-existence of secular and religious elements subsisting under a common umbrella. The secular and religious were figured as complementary and co-constituting aspects of what we might call, after Charles Taylor, an overarching “secularity,” but which Holyoake termed Secularism proper. Holyoake’s Secularism was not only at odds with the understanding of the Bradlaugh camp during his own lifetime but also it differs markedly from the standard secularization thesis as developed from the nineteenth century and beyond. This paper examines the movement that united atheists, skeptics, “agnostics,” and liberal theists, who might cooperate for the material improvement of humanity, especially the working classes, using Secularism as their creed. It particularly emphasizes Holyoake’s insistence on the cooperation among believers and unbelievers. It traces the movement to the Americas and examines the varieties of Secularism that came under Holyoake’s influence, or resisted it.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
On the Origin and Rise of Atheism,Mikko Sillfors,University of Helsinki,Finland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Theism has probably been the most influential belief in human history. However, atheism/naturalism can be traced back to ancient schools like Epicureanism and Cˉarvˉaka (India) and during the last 300 years atheism has gradually become fairly general in some countries. What is the origin of atheism? Why is it increasing? Based on dual-process theory and recent research on atheism a theoretical 'holistic’ hypothesis can be made. According to dual-process theory processes of human mind can be divided into intuitive (automatic, rapid, nonverbal, evolutionary old) and reflective (controlled, slow, linked to language, evolutionary recent). In holistic hypothesis three levels of factors are taken into account in explaining atheism/theism. 1) Biological level. Especially two universally evolved intuitive human cognitive traits — hyperactive agency detection device (HADD) and theory of mind (ToM) — have helped mankind to survive but have also made theism attractive. This partially explains why gods and supernatural beliefs have dominated the human history. 2) Psychological level. Those who are more prone to reflective processing or have deficiency of ToM seem to have a tendency towards atheism. This in part explains why scepticism/atheism is an ancient and universal phenomenon. 3) Sociocultural level. Certain (mostly modern) factors – like general wealth, security, modern environment, freedom of belief, education, secularization, and public visibility of atheism and natural/scientific explanations – seem to decline people’s motivation for religion and/or incline minds into reflective processing. From the viewpoint of holistic hypothesis, both theism and atheism are 'natural’ stances.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Collective Consciousness of Atheism,Mohammad Abdel Haq,"California State University, Fullerton",California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite a doctrine of separation of church and state, religion continues to play a significant role in American politics. Churches facilitate political participation through shared interests, resources, and motivation and religion plays a substantial role in shaping morality, as well as political views and attitudes. Weber argues that the “Protestant Ethic” dominates what is normative in the social and political sphere in the United States. In this study, we examine whether religion is in fact necessary for the creation of a collective moral and political framework or whether secular individuals such as atheists are also capable of sharing a collective consciousness. We do so by asking two questions; first, does a collective political framework exist among atheists? Second, if so, how do the political attitudes of atheists differ from the Protestant majority in regards to party affiliation? We explore these questions using a multinomial logistic regression approach, utilizing data from the 2008 Pew Research Center’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, a nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults. Our results suggest that atheists are very different demographically from Protestants in terms of region, gender, education level, and generation. However, after controlling for these differences, there are still substantial differences in political views and moral attitudes between Protestants and Atheists. We argue that these differences represent differing sets of shared beliefs and moral attitudes, or collective consciousness, between Protestants and Atheist, and are not simply the result of differences in other characteristics.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Irreligious Death: Making Meaning without the Theist Crutch,Nicholas J. MacMurray,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Death is a universal experience, but the meanings and practices surrounding death vary according to cultural and temporal contexts. Examining how different groups approach end of life preparations, death practices, and grief management provides valuable insight into the varied meanings of death and the broader sociocultural context in which they exist. In the United States, death is often understood in the context of religion. As such, secular death practices and grief management is grossly understudied. This ethnographic study is an attempt to understand how individuals with an irreligious worldview handle the management of death within a hegemonic religious context where much of the language and practice surrounding death holds little meaning, and consequently, little value. Because irreligious individuals lack the social crutches provided by religion, they must find other means for confronting death and managing grief. Utilizing a “death acceptance” framework, we identity the unique challenges irreligious individuals face when reconciling the “death of self” and dealing with the “death of other” and outline various irreligious death practices and grief management strategies. We argue that the lack of institutionalized secular death culture increases the difficulty of managing death and grief, but ultimately reinforces an irreligious death acceptance perspective. By focusing inquiry on irreligious understandings, negotiations, and practices surrounding death and the ways in which these contrast with normative social practices at large, this study highlights the need for establishing a more inclusive death culture and contributes to the scholarship on the lived experience of irreligion in the United States today.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheists Still Others? A 10-year Followup on the Findings of the American Mosaic Project,Penny Edgell,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a major national survey fielded in 2003, atheists were named as the least trusted group in American society when compared to a range of other religious and racial out-groups. Michele Lamont has argued that moral worthiness is an important form of social capital in the United States, and religiosity has served as a kind of proxy for this social capital in both private and public life (e.g. for being a good neighbor, or a good citizen). Religion serves as a basis for cultural membership in American life, and a stated rejection of religion (e.g. the affirmation of an atheist identity) serves to define and sharpen a key symbolic boundary that separates authentic/good/true citizens from inauthentic/ problematic ones. In the spring of 2014, a 10-year follow-up survey was fielded by the Boundaries in the American Mosaic project team. In this paper, I compare the findings on religious outsiders in 2014 with those from 2003. Attitudes towards atheists have not changed appreciably in that ten-year time frame, despite the rising percentage and visibility of those claiming no religious identity (the “nones”). In this analysis, I first compare the determinants of atheist distrust in 2003 and 2014 with a special focus on the intersection of age and religiosity. Second, I compare the determinants of atheist distrust with those factors predicting distrust of other small religious out-groups (Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons). My aim is to further our understanding of the role of religiosity in designating insider/ outsider status in American life.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Pope and the “Nones”: Pope Francis and the New Age of Atheism,Peter F. Huff,Centenary College of Louisiana,Louisiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The Catholic church’s Second Vatican Council (1962-65) identified atheism as “one of the most serious problems of our time.” The council’s landmark document, The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, called for “sincere and prudent” dialogue with unbelievers in the age of secularism. Pope Paul VI (1963-78) endorsed dialogue with atheists in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam and established an unprecedented Vatican department to oversee the dialogue: the Secretariat for Non-Believers. He also commissioned the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to make the study of atheism a priority for the priestly order’s intellectual apostolate. A half century after the council, however, Catholic-atheist dialogue remains part of Vatican II’s unfinished agenda. The 2013 papal election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio has sparked new interest in dialogue between believers and unbelievers. A “Francis Effect” has been observed in various areas of ecclesial and social life—from curial reform in the Vatican to public discourse on social justice and gay marriage. This paper investigates the impact of Pope Francis on the relationship of the church to non-believers, especially the “nones” rapidly reshaping contemporary religious experience. The paper traces the development of Francis’ understanding of the phenomenon of modern unbelief from his writings as Jesuit educator and Archbishop of Buenos Aires to his principal papal messages: his encyclical Lumen Fidei, his apostolic letter Evangelii Gaudium, his 2014 World Day of Peace message, and his controversial interviews in La Repubblica and La Civiltà Cattolica. The paper seeks to advance the argument: As the church’s first Jesuit and American pope, Francis brings to his office fresh resources and unexpected perspectives that promise to fulfill Vatican II’s dream of “sincere and prudent” dialogue with the secular world.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives. There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting. However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships. This availability sample collects, in addition to demographics, information on how nones find romantic partners, the demographics of whom nones get involved with romantically, and the quality and duration of relationships. The impact on well-being of not being affiliated with a religion on romantic relationships will also be presented, using both quantitative and qualitative data. This study will add to the knowledge base about the nature of day-to-day lives of nones, as well as, contribute a better understanding of the social and psychological well-being of nones.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
“Splitters!”: Lessons from Monty Python for Nontheist/ Freethought Organizations in the US,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the 19th century saw a wave of popularity for freethinkers in the US, much of this excitement had died down by the early part of the 20th century. Just a handful of nontheist and freethought organizations remained, and most of them were very small and on the verge of collapsing. However, starting in 1941 with the founding of the American Humanist Association and followed by the founding of American Atheists in 1963, the number of nontheist organizations experienced a slow increase. Today, there are several large, national, member-based nontheist/freethought social movement organizations in the US and thousands of smaller, local organizations. In this paper we examine the origins and inter-relations of four of the largest nontheist/freethought organizations in the US: the American Humanist Association, American Atheists, the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. In examining the origins of these organizations, we draw upon several social movement theories but also extend current theorizing by discussing the importance of inter-personal relationships for understanding how social movement organizations “split” or “fracture”. We also discuss whether these “splits” facilitate or hinder the aims of the broader movement in the US.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Universalized – Classical- Secularization Theory,Volkan Ertit,Radbound University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The classical theory of secularization remains one of the most controversial in the field of social science. According to the theory, modernization is the main reason behind the aggressive secularization process now pervading Europe. There are two main issues of discussion among respected sociologists and theologists in this regard. First, there is an ongoing debate on the meaning of the theory, especially among American and European scholars, in which they have yet to find consensus regarding the answers to the questions, “what does the theory assert?” and “what does it not assert?” The second discussion, which cannot be considered separately from the first one, is whether the theory is able to put forward a clear explanation for the bumpy relationship between religion and society in the European context and other parts of the world. In my paper, I will attempt to provide some answers to the two questions mentioned above. Firstly, I will try to shed some light on what the classical secularization theory asserts and does not assert. Then, in a clear departure from more well-known theorists like Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson, I will argue that the theory is not only valid for European societies but for every society at large. To make the theory universal in its relevance, the old classical secularization paradigm needs to be slightly revised. In attempting this, aspects of the old paradigm that belong to the history of Europe and its offshoots (Protestan Reformation) will be somewhat downplayed while those with more universal relevance (scientific advances, urbanization and industrial capitalism) will be highlighted.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Characteristics of Atheist Pre-Service Elementary Teachers,Derek Anderson,Northern Michigan University,Michigan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the beliefs and self-identities of 15 nonreligious pre-service elementary teachers (PSTs), as well as the role their lack of faith plays in their teaching. Semi-structured interviews and participant self-analyses served as data sources, which were used to categorize the PSTs into Silver’s (2013) typology of nonbelief. Notably different from the distribution of Silver’s national sample of nonbelievers, the nonreligious PSTs were much less engaged in their nonbelief and were more willing to comply with religious activities. The nonreligious PSTs were drawn to teaching due to their love of learning, and they intend to promote critical thinking and tolerance in their classrooms; however, 13 (87%) wof the PSTs expressed concern about the negative impact their lack of religion might have on their careers and intend to keep their lack of belief private.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.
“'Need a Minister? How About Your Brother?’: The Universal Life Church between Religion and Non-Religion”,Dusty Hoesly,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"National media outlets have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or lifecycle rituals conducted under its auspices. According to my original survey, interview, and participant observation data, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them typically self-describe as non-religious, usually as spiritual, seekers, humanist, or generically “not religious.” Similarly, they describe their weddings in “non-religious” terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most “religious” language. These “secular” or “spiritual” wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. This article explains why “secular” people select ULC ministers for their weddings, how ULC ministers see themselves as “non-religious” while being members of a legally-recognized religion, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC membership and weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as “religious” and “secular” can be co-constitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.
Espousing Apostasy and Feminism? Older and Younger British Female Apostates Compared,Janet Betty Eccles,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,Rebecca Catto,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It has been acknowledged that white western men are more likely to leave their former religion behind (Altemeyer and Hunsberger, 1997, Zuckerman, 2012), or declare themselves of no religion (Brown and Lynch, 2012, Baker and Smith, 2009), than women (Beit-Hallahmi, 2007). But it has not been unknown for women, even in the past, both of the older and younger generations to do the same (Budd 1977; Schwarz 2010). This article, based on two small scale studies in the United Kingdom, considers a group of older and a group of younger women 'apostates’, to determine what leads them to do this and examines whether developing a feminist orientation plays a role. Religious women in second wave feminism were often ignored, having been considered to have chosen patriarchy over feminism while there is some evidence that women with feminist attitudes are less likely to be religious (Redfern and Aune, 2013, 154, Furseth, 2010, 210). Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis to determine overarching themes, while the three-fold typology of apostasy developed by Zuckerman (2012) allowed the authors to examine similarities and differences between older and younger women who choose to leave religion behind. They conclude reasons for apostasy are various, certainly not solely attributable to developing a feminist orientation.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.
Outline of a Theory of Religious-Secular Competition,Jörg Stollz,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article presents basic elements of a theory of religious-secular competition on the individual level. The theory claims that individuals in many societies may choose between religious and secular options, creating a situation of competition between religious and secular institutions. The competition between religious and secular suppliers is influenced by three important contextual factors: innovation, regulation, and resources. We give six examples of empirical studies showing that the theory of religious-secular competition explains such contrasting phenomena as the difference in success of religious healing in European and African countries, the diminishing and change of religious socialization in Switzerland, variations in church attendance in U.S. states, variation in the attractiveness of monasteries, the late secularization of Ireland, or the success of megachurches since the 1970s.",2015,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

As one of America’s most stigmatized groups, atheists often find members of their own families reacting with anger and rejection, an inability to communicate effectively, and distrust. Many atheists, however, feel continued support and acceptance from family members, experience greater authenticity in their communication, and enjoy relationships with family members who manage to adapt to the atheist’s disclosure of nonbelief.

"Triangle Atheists: Stigma, Identity, and Community Among Atheists in North Carolina’s Triangle Region",Marcus Mann,Duke University,North Carolina,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Sociological studies of atheism have tended to coalesce around three primary themes: stigma, identity, and community. To date, however, no studies have taken a reflexive approach to these themes or applied them in the field to test their analytical utility as well as their relations in contemporary atheist experience. This study employs a mixed-methods approach that includes in-depth interviews (n = 19), participant observation, and one survey administered to two atheist groups, one local (n = 151) and one national (n = 456). Ethnographic findings confirm the central role of stigma, identity, and community in atheist experience and emphasize their nestedness in one another. Survey results find that atheist affiliates in both national and local groups rate political activism as more important than social reasons in motivating them to affiliate, while local affiliates rated social reasons significantly higher than national affiliates rated social reasons. Suggestions for future research include consideration of these themes’ connectedness in subsequent analyses and further inquiry into the functional divergences between local and national atheist organizations.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.

The Roots of Right and Wrong: Do Concepts of Innate Morality Reduce Intuitive Associations of Immorality With Atheism?,Tommy L. Mudd,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,Maxine B. Najle,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,F,Ben K. L. Ng,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,Will Gervais,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,.,.,.,.,"Atheists are frequent targets of prejudice and discrimination. Previous research suggests that anti-atheist prejudice may stem in part from perceptions of religion as an ultimate basis for morality: without God, why do good (or not do bad)? We conducted two studies to test whether presenting recent scientific findings regarding the nonreligious bases of morality (e.g., morality in nonhuman primates and preverbal infants) might lead people to view morality as innate, thus reducing intuitive associations of immorality and atheism. Consistent with previous research, participants viewed moral transgressions as more representative of atheists than of Christians. However, learning about the putatively innate nature of morality did not lead participants to view immorality as less representative of atheists. Intuitive moral distrust of atheists appears quite resilient, persisting even in the face of evidence for the nonreligious origins of morality.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.
Creating Data about Nonreligious Belief,Abby Day,Goldsmiths College,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Abby Day is a leading sociologist of 'belief’. Here, she sets out what working with 'belief’ as a significant category of self-understanding can achieve, for religious 'unbelievers’ as much as for 'believers’. She encourages the use of analytical tools that respond to the complexity and multidimensionality of belief, and introduces her own seven-point method as one such approach.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In this blog I will outline two main methodological issues that are raised when researching belief, and how nonreligion may spill out of the data being created. One of the most common mistakes researchers in human sciences make, using qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods, is to state that 'the data’ are saying something. Data say nothing. The researcher says it all through the subjective experience of conducting research; and all research in human sciences is subjective from the moment the research question is formed, through the research design, to the questions being asked and the conclusions drawn. Methodologically, realising that data don’t 'speak’ – or, at least, that they are part of a broader conversation in which the researcher has played a determining role – is important because it creates a constant state of tension, uncertainty and, ideally, reflexivity in the researcher. For the study of nonreligious belief, this realisation can also free researchers from the strictures of preconceived concepts of what 'unbelief’ entails, whilst still allowing us to work with those concepts constructively instead of discarding them altogether."
Pathways to Organizational Involvement Among Nonbelievers,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research on non-religion has often sampled for nonbelievers via their connections to nonreligious organizations. Making assumptions about nonbelievers as a whole, then, can problematic, since only a portion of nonbelievers are likely to be involved with such groups. Joining a nonreligious organization satisfies a desire for community for some nonbelievers, but social research has not adequately explained why some nonbelievers join while others do not. If nonbelievers are looking for social interaction, intellectual debate, or secular spiritual fulfillment, they can potentially find it via a nonreligious organization; however, organizational affiliation could be a sufficient but unnecessary means of achieving personal goals. This prompts me to ask, what is the difference between the joining and the non-joining nonbeliever? Have they taken different pathways to non-belief and do they experience nonbelief in significantly different ways? In order to determine why some nonbelievers choose not to participate in collective action, and to assess the actual impact of organizations on those who do, non-joiners should be compared to organization members, who may differ systematically from those who join. To answer these questions I interviewed 125 nonbelievers in Houston, Texas, most of whom were involved to varying degrees with nonreligious organizations, but many that were not. I examined respondents’ religious backgrounds, journeys to non-belief, “coming out” experiences, and organizational affiliations to search for similarities and differences in these two groups of nonbelievers.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
On the Virtues of a Meaning Systems Framework for Studying Nonreligious and Religious Worldviews in the Context of Everyday Life,Ann Taves,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Opening the new monthly issue of the [SSNB]-NSRN [methods blog series], Ann Taves explores one of the central questions in contemporary nonreligious studies – and a long-standing religious studies, too: how to understand and describe the object of study. Providing an overview of recent propositions arising from psychology, sociology and anthropology, she sets out a proposal for a meaning systems approach.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In this blog post, I want to take up the central challenge facing those who aim to study nonreligion or secularity and one that has long plagued scholars of religion — that of specifying an object of study. Although several good suggestions have been made, I think we can do a better job of capturing the range of things we want to study by adapting the meaning systems (MS) framework, already in use in psychology, for our purposes. The MS framework, which was designed to encompass both religious and nonreligious meaning systems, allows us to conceptualize our object of study in generic terms. It offers a dynamic framework that has already generated a body of empirical research on the interaction between meaning systems (implicit and explicit) and meaning making in particular situations. Although much of this research has focused on how people cope with trauma, psychologists have extended it to other contexts, including conversion and spiritual transformation. Here I suggest we can build on the framework’s basic distinction between global meaning systems (GMS) and situational meaning (SM) by elaborating the concept of GMS in light of the literature on worldviews and the concept of SM in light of 'situational’ elements, such as practices, networks, institutions, and ways of life, that are typically studied by scholars of religion under the rubric of 'lived religion.’"
Researching the nonreligious in a secular society,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. The visibility of religion in society is low and nonreligiosity is considered normative. Estonians are also one of the nations (along with Czechs) in Europe who’s national identity is associated with atheism, in both cases expressed as “the most atheistic country in the world”. Nevertheless, different beliefs and practices associated with New Spirituality and indigenous Earth belief are very common. Thus, secularity in this context refers mostly to distance from conventional, theistic religion. The paper draws on the data from recent quantitative survey “On Life, Religion, and Religious Life” (2015). Among other questions, the survey offered participants two different possibilities for (non)religious identification, employing also the concept of Multiple Religious Belonging. Beside the information on religiosity, the results of the analysis also give interesting information about nonreligious identities in a secular context. Still, general results of the survey awoke serious doubts about the suitability of quantitative survey on conventional religion in a largely nonreligious society. In order to investigate the relevance of the quantitative survey, I conducted a qualitative study among the nonreligious using mainly the same questions and offering a possibility to explain one’s answers. The results largely confirmed my doubts. The paper addresses the issues that became clear during the qualitative study.

Interpreting Active Forms of Atheism and Secularism as a Social Movement,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the wake of so-called „New Atheism“, especially organized forms of nonreligion, atheism, and/or secularism have attracted an unprecedented degree of scholarly attention (see e.g. Cimino and Smith 2014, LeDrew 2016). These studies, mostly on the North American spectrum of atheist, humanist, and secularist organizations, have treated their subject, quite matter-of-factly, as a social movement. In my presentation, I would like to apply theoretical insight from the sociology of social movements to the study of nonreligion and secularity – more specifically to atheist, humanist, and secularist activism in the United States and Germany. On the one hand, I would like to analyze systematically in how far the field of organized and non-organized atheism, humanism, and secularism meets definitions of a social movement and in how far it can justifiably be called that. Most definitions of social movements place emphasis on the existence of formal and informal networks of collective and individual actors, a shared identity, a battle against political or cultural enemies, and the use of non-institutionalized means. So, on the other hand, I am going to portray the formal and informal networks in this field as well as recent dynamics and divergencies with respect to identity, opponents, and strategy using theories of collective action and collective identity. The aim of my paper, therefore, is both theoretical as well as descriptive: bringing theory from the sociology of social movements to fruition in the context of a new subject matter and broadening the empirical treatment of that subject matter to a European case.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Making implicit nonreligious attitudes visible: secular criticism of religion and spirituality within societal institutions,Christiane Königstedt,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The study of nonreligion is, besides analyses of state secularism, very often concerned with nonreligious persons in the minority position, who are themselves perceived as contestations to religious world-views. For the opposite case, i.e. secular societies where nonreligious world-views are also dominant, Charles Taylor and José Casanova (2011) stated, that the latter would have the tendency to “naturalize” and thus become unconsciously held attitudes. Since what is taken for granted is rarely mentioned explicitly as well as there is by no means a canonized set of nonreligious beliefs collectively shared, those are difficult investigate beyond visible conflicts provoked by either religious groups or by perceived transgressions of taken-for-granted secular realms. Contestations and resulting negotiations may constitute a chance for the researcher (Knott 2007) to investigate 'naturalized’ assumptions, when it is explicated in order to explain the criticism groups, beliefs or practices. While it has shown that collective actors, groups, are more likely to be differentiated from the “in-group” through evoking a secular collective identity, subtle punctual transgressions of boundaries may reveals details about more diffused nonreligious – and implicit – attitudes and opinions. In this paper I will analyse examples for the latter case, precisely a sample of criticism(s) expressed in German online-newspapers towards perceived transgressions of legitimate (often medical) science by religio-spiritual world-views. Testing Taylor’s and Casanova’s claim in this practical area, the pivotal questions are 'what is precisely perceived as challenge and how is it characterized’? What is, on the other hand, perceived to be in need of protection, what are the feared dangers? What singular arguments and values are explicated in that defence? The findings from the material shall be discussed concerning their significance and surplus value for the study of nonreligion.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Early-Modern Irreligion and Theological Analogy: A Response to Gavin Hyman’s A Short History of Atheism,Daniel J. Linford,Thomas Nelson Community College,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Historically, many Christians have understood God’s transcendence to imply God’s properties categorically differ from any created properties. For multiple historical figures, a problem arose for religious language: how can one talk of God at all if none of our predicates apply to God? What are we to make of creeds and Biblical passages that seem to predicate creaturely properties, such as goodness and wisdom, of God? Thomas Aquinas offered a solution: God is to be spoken of only through analogy (the doctrine of analogy). Gavin Hyman argues Aquinas’s doctrine of analogy was neglected prior to the early-modern period and the neglect of analogy produced the conception of a god vulnerable to atheistic arguments. Contra Hyman, in this paper, I show early-modern atheism arose in a theological context in which there was an active debate concerning analogy. Peter Browne (1665–1735) and William King (1650–1729) offered two competing conceptions of analogical predication that were debated through the 19th century, with interlocutors such as the freethinker Anthony Collins (1676–1729), theologian/philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and skeptic David Hume (1711–1776). Lastly, I discuss the 18th century debate over theological analogy as part of the background relevant to understanding Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

From their recent research they detail the particular obstacles they overcame and elucidate how different questions on measuring non-belief produce much different answers.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In quantitative analysis, atheism is often used as a concept to describe those who state that they do not believe, when asked what they believe about God or those that indicate that they are not a member of a religious organization. It seems as if researchers treat atheism as the 'residual category’ in their study of religion. However, the recent debate on atheism, religious 'nones’ and non-religiosity suggests that this sociological habit of categorizing non-believers and non-affiliates as atheists, does not do justice to the intricacies of the atheist identity. There exists a great difference between say, an attender of an atheist gathering like the Sunday Assembly and a supporter of the American Atheists movement. Therefore, quantitatively oriented scholars should be very careful in their operationalization of the tolerant and almost spiritual kind of atheism on the one hand (better described as non-religious or a-religious), and the militant and provocative atheism on the other (better depicted as anti-religious). In our recent studies on non-religiosity and anti-religiosity in Western Europe, we discovered that operationalizing these differences is not so easy. We encountered three particular obstacles. First, the commonly used surveys for the study of religion, culture, and politics (for instance, EVS, ISSP) use different questions for measuring similar religious beliefs and attitudes. Second, they have very few items that lend themselves to distinguishing anti-religiosity from non-religiosity in general and religious indifference in particular. Third, there are a limited number of options for operationalizing different kinds of anti-religiosity, for example anti-Muslim sentiment. Now, researchers like us have two options: we could decide to dismiss datasets designed to measure religiosity as useless for understanding non-religiosity; or we could gloss over the differences and imagine that non-religiosity really is quite a straightforward matter. With this blog, we describe the way in which we overcame these pitfalls."

Rather, such findings are relevant for understanding more indirect causes of people’s behavior and for explaining why certain types of explicit beliefs are more easily spread. When studying implicit processes in the context of religion and nonreligion, researchers have utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. A common methodological feature that these studies share is that they assess people’s beliefs indirectly. This means that, instead of asking the participants to report their own evaluation of the effects of their beliefs, participants are not fully aware of the particular beliefs the researchers are measuring."

In this post, I want to discuss a specific issue that continues to stifle the nascent field of what we might call “spirituality studies.” It seems to me that those of us interested in “spirituality” have not yet figured out how to adequately study this puzzling phenomenon.

British Ex-Muslims: Constructing and negotiating the "essential and revolutionary",Halima Begum,Birkbeck University of London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The phenomenon of people leaving their religion is a common feature of many post-Christian Western societies. However, the investigation of the phenomenon of apostasy has mainly been restricted to Christian apostates. Apostasy in minority communities, specifically the Muslim community, is not well understood. This study investigates the why and the how of the construction of the “Ex-Muslim” identity, defined as atheists and agnostics who have left Islam. A small-scale study with a qualitative, grounded theory approach within a social constructivism paradigm was used to explore the construction of the Ex-Muslim identity, and how Ex-Muslims managed and negotiated the stigma attached to their identity. Ten semistructured interviews and one focus group (five participants) were conducted to investigate why participants chose to call themselves 'Ex-Muslims’ and what the consequences of embracing this identity were. Results revealed two dimensions to understand this identity. The first category conceptualises the stigmatisation from Muslim and the non-Muslim society, and a displacement of the self, lack of parental acceptance and gendered experiences as the defining factors in the realities of Ex-Muslims. The second category showed the strategies used to navigate the Ex-Muslim identity, consisting of a complex set of performance acts to manage social interactions as well as the construction of an Ex-Muslim community. The results show that the conditions of stigmatisation of apostasy can stimulate the displacement of the self, resulting into an evolving Ex-Muslim identity. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of negotiation of identities through performances (Goffman, 1963) as well as the concept of the 'ex’ role identity (Ebaugh, 1988).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
"Authorizing Atheism: Leadership, Gender, and the Cult of Personality",Hannah Scheidt,Northwestern University,Illinois,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, I examine authority in contemporary atheism through visual culture. My sources include fan art, cartoons, and Internet memes. This paper therefore adopts a cultural studies approach to contemporary atheism, contributing an understanding of how atheism operates “on the ground” as much more than a simple lack of belief. Much has been made about the works of New Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, but relatively little has been done to analyze how they are consumed and reproduced, interpreted and critiqued, by everyday atheists. I address the tension between contemporary atheists’ skepticism regarding traditional authority and their simultaneous acceptance of some modes and sources of authority. Atheists themselves are aware of this tension, and treat it thoughtfully, playfully, and self-reflexively (jokingly calling Dawkins, for example, the Atheist Pope). I also connect my observations about authority in contemporary atheism with a commentary about gender in today’s atheist network, a subject for which my cultural sources provide rich material. This paper draws from cultural studies, religious studies, media studies, and gender studies in an effort to better understand how atheists builds narratives, community, and culture in deeply complex relationship with their understandings of religion, and not simply in reaction or opposition to religion.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

Failing God? The effects of Church scandals on Catholic belief and affiliation in Ireland,Hugh Turpin,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I will present on my research into the effects of perceived 'religious hypocrisy’ on religious belief and affiliation, focusing on the context of contemporary Irish Catholicism. Despite collapses in trust and practice since the promulgation of the clerical sexual abuse scandals from the early 1990s onwards and a swiftly growing minority identifying as non-religious, survey data still return unusually high levels of religious belief and affiliation in Ireland by European standards, something that has led sociologists to propose that by and large the Irish population remain 'believers’ and 'cultural Catholics’ despite their growing lack of institutional engagement (Davie, 1994; Donnelly & Inglis, 2009). My research examines the accuracy of this characterisation utilising a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Dublin with experimental techniques built on a theoretical standpoint taken from the cognitive science of religion. These experiments aim to directly test whether religious credence is undermined when cultural learners witness 'Credibility Undermining Displays’, namely instances where religious paragons fail to 'practice what they preach’ (Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012). My presentation will cover the preliminary data yielded by these experiments, and compliment this with the more nuanced qualitative findings drawn from my fieldwork and interviews among informants from two Dublin parishes. Together, it is hoped that these preliminary findings will suggest insights regarding how exactly the discrediting of the Church relates to contemporary Irish secularization.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
“They Just Don’t Stand for Nothing”: LGBT Christians’ Definitions of Non-Religious Others,Jason Edward Sumerau,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this exploratory study, I examine how a group of LGBT Christians conceptualized non-religious others. Based on over 450 hours of fieldwork in an LGBT Christian church located in the southeastern region of the United States, I demonstrate how a group of LGBT Christians defined non-religious others as (1) morally suspect and untrustworthy, (2) in need of salvation and guidance, and (3) poor representations of the LGBT community. Although these LGBT Christians used “non-religious” as a catchall term without ever specifying exactly who it captured, they used the first two definitions to apply to non-religious people in general regardless of sexuality while explicitly focusing on non-religious sexual minorities in their third definition. Moreover, I show how these definitions echoed mainstream religious rhetoric in America used to marginalize both sexual and religious minorities. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how religious depictions of non-religious people may reproduce societal patterns of inequality; and (2) the importance of analyzing how religious people define and interpret non-religious others.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

He argues that Japanese nonreligiousness has altered strategies of Japanese Christian missions and influenced the bridal industry.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Statistically speaking, the vast majority of contemporary Japanese self-identify as nonreligious. However, this self-identification is far from a wholesale rejection of religion, and often employed both to reject and affirm religious behaviors and identities. Most typically, nonreligious attitudes reject religious dispositions that are perceived as deviant, unhealthy, or foreign while simultaneously affirming religion’s importance. Nonreligious individuals tend to rely on religious professionals and vicariously entrust specialized acts of prayer and ritual to religious authorities when desirable and appropriate. Along with various Buddhist and Shinto rites, Christian wedding ceremonies are now one of the occasions where nonreligious Japanese rely on religious professionals. Nonreligious attitudes are responsible for significant transformations in Japanese Christianity and the bridal industry and the successful response of the Christian churches and the bridal industry to consumer demand has led to an explosion in Christian wedding ceremonies. In short, the popularity of Christian weddings among nonreligious individuals has transformed the policies and approaches of Christian churches and created new Christian ritual venues and religious organizations."
"Kids, You Make the Choice: Religious and Secular Socialization among Marginal Affiliates and Nonreligious Individuals",Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"What approaches do parents or those who plan to have children employ to socialize their children about religious or secular identification, beliefs, and practices? In what ways do primary and secondary socialization agents interact in this process? How might cultural narratives shape or be shaped by primary and secondary socialization activities? I address these questions by drawing on sixty interviews with two groups of Canadians – those who identify with a Christian group but limit attendance to religious holidays and rites of passage (marginal affiliates), and those who do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services (nonreligious individuals). I found that marginal affiliates did or planned to expose their children to religious belief and practice, while nonreligious individuals were inclined to defer to their children. However, marginal affiliates and nonreligious individuals jointly maintained that children should have choice in this matter. Parents did not or planned not to impose religious or secular views on children. Further, one’s upbringing informed parental socialization strategies and tactics that were largely informed by prevailing Canadian cultural narratives.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

Consequently, I began to investigate atheism with the cognitive and evolutionary sciences in mind, conducting fieldwork with atheist and humanist groups in the US, UK, and Denmark and running interviews, surveys, and experiments. Taking a cognitive perspective, I believe, allows us to escape the post-modern malaise that too-often arises when we recognize the socially-constructed nature of our key objects of analysis.  In short, a cognitive perspective helps make the scientific study of atheism possible."
On the Necessity of Fractionating “Atheism”,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Can “atheism,” be an object of scientific analysis? Academics and other social actors approach “atheism” with a range of interests, producing substantial diversity in how the term is defined, analysed, and utilised. Given the importance of such interests in conceptual construction, one may ask whether “atheism” exists as an independent phenomenon amenable to scientific analysis, or, rather, following the supposed fate of “religion” (Smith, 1998; Fitzgerald, 2000) and the “secular” (Asad, 2003), as a mere social construction. This question is not without consequence. If “atheism” only exists as a socially constructed concept and not as an independent object, then analysis of its supposed causes and effects becomes, like astrology, folly. I will argue that “atheism” is indeed a social construct. This would seem to doom any scientific study of atheism and leave us only to document how the term is experienced and utilized by various social actors. However, I will argue that a science of atheism is still possible. To do so, I will utilize the metatheoretical principle of “fractionation” developed by cognitive anthropologists (Boyer, 1994; Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014) in their scientific studies of “religion.” Fractionating a constructed object of analysis involves breaking it up into distinct phenomena about whose independence we are more confident and which may have divergent causes and effects. Based on my field and survey research with atheists in the US, UK, and Denmark, as well as insights from the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, I will propose three (non-exhaustive) fractionated elements of “atheism:” 1) absence of (implicit/explicit) belief in the existence of God/gods, 2) moral judgement of the immorality of “religion,” and 3) social identities that prominently feature “atheism” or other forms of “nonreligion.” I will argue that each exists in the world beyond our scholarly conceptions and with distinct sets of causes and effects.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Reimagining the Secular: The Sunday Assembly - Belonging without Believing.,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Grace Davie (1994) famously wrote over two decades ago that 'the overall pattern of religious life is changing. For it appears that more and more people within British Society want to believe but do not want to involve themselves in religious practice.’ Hence, the catchphrase 'believing without belonging’ was coined. Twenty-two years later has the (non)religious landscape changed once again? My doctoral research follows the Sunday Assembly, a secular congregation that celebrates life, with the motto: live better, help often and wonder more. Their vision is: to help everyone live life as fully as possible. The Sunday Assembly entered the non-religious market place in January 2013 with their flagship London congregation. Now, 68- franchised chapters of the Godless congregation exist in 8 different countries, attempting to provide community, belonging and wonder to the religiously unaffiliated market. Once described as 'the best bits of church but with no religion and with awesome pop songs!’, the best bits literally borrow established successful terminology, practices, liturgies and models of building community found within Christian churches. Often labelled oxymoronically the 'atheist church’ - it parallels and mimics the functionality of church life without the need for a deity. Therefore, studying the Sunday Assembly may offer a new variation to Davie’s 'believing without belonging’ that is 'belonging without believing.’ As more and more people now identify as being non-religious in the United Kingdom and America, this paper will aim to answer what factors are enticing people towards the Sunday Assembly and their nonreligious practice. This paper will present findings from my analysis of the Sunday Assembly. Drawing upon 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews and a year-long ethnography spent with the London Sunday Assembly congregation.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Non-Religious Individuals’ Life Satisfaction: Examining the Role of Belief Certainty and Context Factors,Katharina Pöhls,University of Cologne,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Based on the assumption of a curvilinear effect of belief certainty instead of belief content on psychological well-being, this individual paper explores the influence of belief certainty on non-religious individuals’ life satisfaction with regard to the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development. Self-identification as atheist is used as an indicator for non-religiousness with a high belief certainty. The social norm of non-religiosity is indicated by the national level of individuals identifying as not religious or atheist and the level of societal development is indicated by the level of a population’s health, education, and standard of living. The World Values Survey is used as data source for a quantitative intercultural comparison across 31 countries (N=49,611). Results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average more satisfied with life than atheist and non-religious individuals when only including individual-level variables in the analysis, but that they do not differ in their average level of life satisfaction when interactions with the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development are considered. Additionally, the difference between atheist and religious individuals’ life satisfaction decreases with higher levels of non-religiosity in society. It will be discussed why these results challenge the assumption of religiosity being related to a general advantage concerning individuals’ well-being.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

So what causes anti-atheist prejudice both inside and outside of the political arena?  Why are atheists viewed so negatively in the United States, even by other atheists? To help answer these questions, we might consider a new study conducted by psychologists Corey L. Cook, Florette Cohen, and Sheldon Solomon (2015) entitled What If They’re Right About the Afterlife?  Evidence of the Role of Existential Threat on Anti-Atheist Prejudice. Adding to the ever-growing body of research on anti-atheist prejudice, which has already connected such prejudice to concerns about atheists being untrustworthy and threatening to in-group values, this study focused on the existential threat that atheism poses to theistic worldviews. Specifically, the researchers based their hypotheses on terror management theory, originally developed by Solomon himself along with two other psychologists, which posits that “the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror that is assuaged by cultural worldviews that afford a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe,” in order to see whether atheists, by holding to a worldview which denies a belief in God or an afterlife, threaten to undermine the terror-buffer that religious worldviews often generate. In brief, the two separate experiments in this study found a significant empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudice."

I intended the book as a response to, and partly a reaction against, the 'religious turn’ in gender and feminist history of the last 20 years or so. But Infidel Feminism, was also intended as an intervention into scholarship on secularism, to say something new about the category of the secular as a whole and to take forward debates on the secularization thesis and 'post-secularity’.

By using a historical case study, Fraser hopes to push back against viewing atheism as either a purely political or purely intellectual phenomenon and instead suggests that only a multi-disciplinary study can fully make sense of atheism.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"It is a common belief in many Western societies that politics and religion should be separate, and that religion should play little or no role in the governance of modern states. This belief, in turn, can support two other assumptions: first, that it is possible to have religious beliefs whose significance is purely intellectual, and which possess no political meaning; and second, that the absence or rejection of religious language, symbols, and narratives in political life implies neutrality or indifference toward the intellectual cogency of religious belief. These beliefs can affect the methodologies we use, as is seen in different approaches toward New Atheism. On the one hand are a range of polemical works that seek to defend or refute the intellectual plausibility of its core arguments, with little consideration of its social and political significance. On the other hand are works by Schulzke, Kettell, and McAnulla, which have sought to move beyond this intellectual and polemical approach by conceptualising New Atheism as a primarily political movement. In contrast to these overly intellectual or political methods, historians of Protestant freethought such as Budd, Reventlow, and Champion have long noted the inter-dependent relationship between atheism, theology, and political protest."
"Jewish Atheists, Protestant Humanists and Nonreligious Agnostics: Existential Culture, 'Hybridity’ and Nonreligious Diversity",Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The existential dimension of human life has been a minor theme in contemporary social science, in line with the dominant view in social theory (e.g. modernization theory, secularization theory) that the decline of religion, detraditionalisation and other processes of social transformation serve to diminish existential experience in modern and late modern societies. In contrast to such theories, this paper presents evidence that existential life is reformed rather than reduced in contemporary societies. It draws on qualitative research exploring nonreligious identification in southeast England to demonstrate the ways in which informants engage with the existential and metaphysical, not only through thought and belief, but also through rituals, symbolic forms and social interactions. It shows how the variety and cultural contingency of these existential cultures can provide new ways to understand the diversity of nonreligious beliefs and cultures. It also points to commonalities and opportunities for cultural exchange between religious, spiritual and nonreligious existential cultures, and the ways in which individuals may draw on and sometimes combine these different traditions. I argue that a cultural turn in understandings of atheism, nonreligion and secularity help us to understand these complex or 'hybrid’ existential cultural formations.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

However, today, the issue is not the same as it was for researchers a decade ago – pioneering new empirical projects and trying to get to grips with long taken-for-granted concepts like 'atheism’ and 'irreligion’ in order to do so. For new scholars, the challenge is accessing all that these earlier scholars have learned – and ensuring that they don’t have to repeat the same conceptual explorations, or wander up the blind alleys that others have already realised are dead-ends. Today, the issue is much more about having a centralised body of work to turn to, a point of access to a resource setting out, simply and clearly, what others have already learned. To date, there has been a lack of standardization, not only across disciplines but within them, leading either to uncertainty about a concept’s meaning or crossed-wires. What is more, lacking a centralised conceptual resource limits scholars opportunities to scrutinise and develop core concepts in light of new knowledge, to build more nuanced models, and to triangulate and accumulate knowledge."

From the very outset – the point of research design – we need to decide on the issue to be explained. Take, for example, the striking gender imbalance in the atheist movement – one of the most prominent gender issues in the field. Why so few women? It may then be the case that women do not differ from men in their initial attraction to atheist activities, but the gap widens as a result of women’s direct experience of the atheist milieu. The initial gendering of the atheist movement, through the high profiles of its male figures and marginalisation of their female counterparts, sets the tone for the subsequent patterns of participation. The focus on atheism in studies of nonreligion is also inevitably gendered because the term 'atheist’ tends to appeal more to men than to women who prefer 'agnostic’ or 'not religious’."
Contested Secularism(s) in Bangladesh,Mascha Schulz,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism and the role of religion in the public sphere in Bangladesh have been highly contested issues in Bangladesh since a long period, but contestation and polarization have regained remarkable intensity in the recent past. In this context also the academic writing on the issue of secularism, national identity and religion in Bangladesh and concomitant conflicts has remerged with new impetus. In this presentation I will explore the light that recent academic writing sheds on contested secularism in Bangladesh. I will summarize the existing literature by pointing to different narratives and motives frequently presented in the literature. This will help us to understand how these contestations around religion and secularism in Bangladesh are commonly interpreted and how various issues and conflicts are conflated within these debates. As a second step, I will discuss to which extend the scholarly works can themselves be considered as part of politics around the contested issue of “secularism” and the role of religion in Bangladesh. Therefore, I will summarize which implicit or explicit claims or political statements are made by the authors, and in which ways these statements relate to the positions of respective authors as well as academia in general. Further, I would like to contrast the academic discourse concerning issues related to secularism in Bangladesh to the emerging scholarship that discusses ways of conceptualizing non-religion and secularism. Consequently, I will use a few selected approaches to argue that a conversation between both so far largely disconnected corpuses of scholarship can be of mutual benefit as it allows a critical review of the existing narratives and debates in both of them. I will conclude my presentation with proposing possible approaches that will allow us a deeper understanding of the politics of secularism in Bangladesh.

She thoroughly documents the role of freethinkers in France that follows the work of Albert Bayet and Pierre Leveque. However, Lalouette, Bayet, and Leveque give a limited analysis of the reasons for the rupture with the Church. Lalouette briefly notes that freethinkers were born into freethought families, revolted intellectually, or morally rejected the idea of God (such as after experiencing the horrors of World War One). Studying the deconversion testimonies of the évadés and freethinkers puts their voice back into the historical record. They believed they were living through a great spiritual crisis and transition. The Church could have found a way to embrace change. Instead, the Catholic hierarchy resisted reform, pushing many believers into a tenuous spirituality or unbelief and direct cultural conflict."
Being areligious in Antiquity – Individual Dimensions of Disbelief,Nicole Hartmann,Humboldt-University of Berlin,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Studies on Antiquity are mostly stuck in their dependence on literary sources. Philosophical, antiquarian, judicial or theological reflections, tragic, satirical, polemical or apologetic texts were mostly produced by 'organizational men' (Jörg Rüpke). They set the agenda of proper behaviour, norms and practices and, what they consider to be deviant. They create the dichotomy of 'religion' and 'atheism'. „Battling the Gods. Atheism in the Ancient World“ (2015) by Tim Whitmarsh is just the latest example of how difficult it is for scholars to look beyond these dominating discourses. The project I am thinking about aims at individual aspects of disbelief and personal reasons for denying to participate in rituals and cults or merely being indifferent towards 'religion'. So far my approach is informed by the 'Lived Ancient Religion' concept of the ERC funded Research Group at the Max Weber Kolleg Erfurt and the theoretical framework of the 'Multiple Secularities' project at the University of Leipzig. The biggest methodological challenge will be the quest for sources and testimonies, since there are no ego-documents of 'confessing' sceptics or atheists. One has to analyze indirect sources as, for example, leges sacrae and will meet a lot of difficulties to distinguish wilful disregard from unintentional transgression etc. Nonetheless, in my point of view, it is about time to conceptualize these individual dimensions of non-religion for the ancient world (namely in the time and space of the Roman Empire) and ask about the dynamics it set free in groups responses.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

I make this argument by reflecting on the sermon that Giorgio Agamben gave in Notre Dame Cathedral in March 2009. The argument has three main components: 1) the church is understood to be a community of foreigners and exiles as opposed to citizens of a city, state, kingdom or empire; 2) the church is marked by a distinctive relation to time which is in tension with the chronological timeframe of a particular socio-political construct of law or state, in our case Western neo-liberal representative democracy; 3) the way that community can form and flourish is in an extraordinary kind of tension between the poles presented in the first two points, namely aliens and citizens and chronological and eschatological time. Taking these components in order, I will look at several characteristics from the genealogy of Western European Secularity that can help provide for this ecclesial recovery. I will then suggest that there can be a positive tension between secularity and a Jesus style of church, and that this can engender a flourishing community for all. I will then refer to the current refugee crisis as a context for this."

This blog has focused on a limited set of US-based surveys, but similar effects have been found elsewhere. What this work shows is that scholars interested in studying nonreligious and nonbelieving individuals need to recognize that how questions are framed will influence the results they get. There are many ways to ask about religious belonging and believing, and most of these aren’t intrinsically wrong or right – so long as the data are analysed and interpreted in a way that is sensitive to what the question is doing. On the other hand, some questions are very, very wrong, and scholars should be at pains to avoid them."

They preferred terms such as emotional connectedness, awe, or beauty, which are commonly included in definitions of spirituality. For a few individuals, spirituality referred to the existence of spirits.

Using the case of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I argue that 'secular’ self-fashioning may sometimes have little to do with individuals engaging the secular-religious boundary in a particular society through processes of self-differentiation. I also argue that hiloni cultivation of reasonableness is an emotio-political outcome of a long-standing and unresolved ideological problem within Zionist thought. Reasonableness is not simply an emotional practice of self-cultivation but has also – indirectly and often unintentionally – facilitated and rendered opaque practices of Israeli state sovereignty over many aspects of Palestinian life. Secularity has facilitated sovereign governance of Palestinian social life but not through political secularism per se, which further illuminates the intersection between individual 'secular affect’ and state sovereignty.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Grassroots Atheism and the Atheist Movement,Stephen LeDrew,Uppsala University,Sweden,M,Evelina Lundmark,Uppsala University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this research we examine research done on the (at the time) unmoderated and hugely popular online atheist forum – reddit.com/r/atheism – in relation to the ideology new atheism and the atheist movement in North America. The study on /r/atheism was a qualitative study conducted in early 2013, which traced discursive practices on an online space with no official ties to atheist or humanist organizations. The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the 'practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory. Our cooperation has thus impelled us to ask questions regarding the use and construction of atheism in our respective work, as well as questions on which scientific research inform our different choices, and how this is reflected in the write up process.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Atheism on YouTube for the last ten years,Stephen Pihlaja,Newman University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Looking at the spread and negotiation of a particular controversy between atheists and Christians, Stephen Pihlaja examines how YouTube users negotiate tensions in a particular social space and how the collapse of a recognisable context for these negotiations affect the ways in which they put forth their beliefs. Pihlaja shows how close analysis of interaction on social media can provide insights about the religious arguments and discussions develop over time.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"For the last ten years, my research has followed atheists and Christians on social media and YouTube. As a social media site, YouTube particularly has played an important role in the visibility of atheism, providing a platform for atheists to challenge religious dogma. This has been particularly true for the American context, where many of the YouTube atheists I have research are located. In America, atheism is still viewed with suspicion, and consistently one of the most distrusted minorities. Particularly in places like the deep southern states, identifying as an atheist remains problematic. YouTube, however, has facilitated 'coming out’ as an atheist, a topic that has been of interest to researchers in the sociology of religion. My research has shown that religious discussions and arguments cannot be divorced from the social context in which they take place. This has grown increasingly more complicated with the development of new mobile technology and the integration of offline and online lives. My research now looks at the ways in which 'context collapse’ (or the diverse audiences watching users on social media from a variety of different, disparate backgrounds) has affected how users present themselves and their beliefs or lack of beliefs online. In 2006, many users couldn’t say they were atheists in offline settings, but could do so on YouTube; now, it’s potentially much easier to declare a lack of faith, but users have a growing awareness of all the different people watching them."
Politics and Religion in Contemporary Turkey: Perspectives of Atheists,Tayfun Kasapoglu,Vytautas Magnus University,Lithuania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a society where religion is very present in public life, conducting research on atheists itself may become an act of contestation, especially if atheists constitute a small minority and are perceived as deviant in the society. In my on-going qualitative research on self-identified atheists in contemporary Turkey, I aim to investigate atheists’ perceptions on relations between politics and religion, as well as to understand how this relationship affects atheists’ personal experiences in society. As a part of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with atheists from different backgrounds in Turkey. In these interviews, atheists based their perspectives on personal experiences and did not strictly differentiate between religious and nonreligious. The informants often perceived current politics and religion as closely linked to each other and underlined an increasing religiosity and polarization in society drawing on examples related to media, gender, politics and education. While there were significant differences between opinions of atheists from religious and secular families, almost all the informants regarded religion as an expansionist power that is becoming more visible in every area of social life with the policies imposed by the current right-wing government. They recommended limiting religion to the private sphere and thus creating secular spaces in which not only religious Muslims but everyone could thrive.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Angels and the Digital Afterlife: Studying Nonreligion Online,Tim Hutchings,University of Nottingham,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the second instalment of the SSNB/NSRN methods blog, Tim Hutchings argues that the scope and significance of digital methodologies for the study of – and beyond – 'nonreligion’ is much broader and more promising than is often perceived.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In some areas of the internet, the line between religion and nonreligion could not be clearer. Elsewhere online, the boundary between religion and nonreligion becomes much harder to trace. If we only pay attention to the most explicit forms of anti-religion, we risk missing some of the more subtle and interesting negotiations of what it actually means to be (or not to be) “religious”. We can also miss whole areas of activity in which the boundary doesn’t seem to mean very much at all. As Dusty Hoesly argues in a recent article in Secularism and Nonreligion, 'religious, spiritual, secular, and nonreligious identities are not stable, unitary formations’, but performances, 'discursive, relational constructions contingently articulated in particular locations at specific times for particular purposes’. Researchers interested in digital nonreligion need to look out for those performances, and to develop methodologies that are sensitive to their transient contexts and implications."
The Christmas bear: merry reflections on the sacred in a secular Christmas,Timothy Stacey,Goldsmiths College,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Timothy Stacey reflects on secular spirits of giving in this festive period… ",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Standing in the urinals of a pub in Bangalore, India, I look up to see a Christmas-themed poster. A bear, wearing a Christmas hat, invites me to “get merry this Christmas – and not just on our beer”. I was about to dismiss the poster as a depressing example of the needless secularization and commercialisation of Christmas. Though barely raised Christian, I suppose I had always assumed that Christian symbols such as, say, the nativity scene, still reminded what we might call post-Christian (raised Christian and still influenced by Christian culture despite neither believing nor attending church) celebrants that Christmas was about remembering the poor. I was about to dismiss the poster, but realising I had nothing better to do, decided to read on. In fact, the Christmas bear invited me to get merry by gifting money to a poor child. I had been too quick to judge. Later, I saw how those taking up the offer had been incorporated into a public ritual,immortalized by writing their name beside a picture of the child they had helped on a paper tag, which had been draped in the branches of a Christmas tree, where normally decorative baubles might hang. I reflected on how a secular Christmas had nonetheless sacralized and ritualised giving and receiving, and this ritual in itself might be a strong enough anchor from which to inspire solidarity with the poor."
The Varieties of Personal Orientations to Religion: Dynamics of Religious and Nonreligious Positions in Self-Narratives of Well-Educated Young Adults in the Netherlands,Ulrike Popp-Baier,University of Amsterdam,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Self-narratives are well-known resources from which to analyze the subtleties of people’s orientations toward “religion“. They provide the necessary biographical context for addressing individual religiousness in the context of personal concerns, experiences and orientations, thus stressing the diversity and varieties of people’s religious orientations and experiences which are embedded in processes of interpretation and reflection related to activities and events in daily life, and evolving and changing in the course of a lifetime. “Religious” or “nonreligious” people are often not only addressing, adopting, or contesting various contents of belief in plural religious contexts, but also demonstrating various “modes of belief or unbelief ” such as being convinced, trusting, hoping, assuming, preferring, doubting, pondering, denying etc. When we consider these varieties, clear-cut distinctions between “being religious” and “being nonreligious” will often disappear. The main research question in our current project is: What types of religiousness are discernable among well-educated adults in the Netherlands ? We started our empirical research with a preliminary exploratory study which is still ongoing. Until yet 20 selfnarratives (gained by a combination of biographical-narrative interviews with semi-structured interviews) of students at polytechnic institutes of higher learning in the Netherlands have been gathered. The purposive sample aims at maximal variation among self-ascribed religiousness, spirituality, nonreligiousness and non-spirituality. Thus far Catholics and former Catholics, Protestants and former Protestants, Muslims, people affiliated with the socalled holistic milieu and people with no religious affiliation or interest in spirituality at all have been included into the sample. Besides different constellations of religiousness, nonreligiousness, spirituality and “non-spirituality”, a thematic coding analysis of the 20 interviewtranscripts also revealed two common patterns in the interviews thus far: a moral orientation to life and variations of a just-world belief (Lerner, 1980). This paper will elaborate on the different constellations and on the common patterns as well. Conceptual and methodological consequences for a psychological study of “nonreligiousness” will be discussed.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

She shows how reframing such research as stimulating of 'unbelief’ open new avenues for new ways of exploring the nature of unbelief and its similarities and dissimilarities to religious and spiritual beliefs.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Recent technological advances have made it possible to influence brain processes through neuromodulation. This is a technology which influences neurons in the brain through either focused magnetic fields (such as in transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS for short) or a weak electrical current emitted by electrodes placed on the skull (transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS for short). TMS can induce or impede action potentials in neurons, thus stimulating or inhibiting brain regions, while tDCS modulates the neuronal excitability of the target area – this can be positive, when the neuronal excitability is increased, or negative, when the neuronal excitability is decreased. Together these studies suggest that neuromodulation can induce changes in beliefs. The majority of the studies used TMS, and in particular inhibitory TMS. A number of questions remain, and they point to questions of significance for the study of 'unbelieving’ as well as religious and spiritual forms of believing: How long lasting and powerful are the effects of neuromodulation on belief, and what does this tell us about the stability of belief and unbelief between contexts and over time? Can neuromodulation turn an atheist into a devout believer – or a religious individual into an ardent atheist? Or do articulate forms of 'positive atheism’ also provide opportunities for self-transcendence so that some forms of unbelief behave similarly to religious and spiritual belief? What brain regions need to be targeted to achieve these changes, and what does this tell us about the nature of belief and unbelief? Can tDCS, a more affordable method of neuromodulation, induce the same effects as TMS in studies on belief?"
Honest Answers to Awkward Questions,Will Gervais,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this installment of the SSNB/NSRN Methods Blog series, psychologist Will Gervais introduces us to the unmatched count technique for survey research.  This technique is designed to allow survey takers to give more honest answers to awkward questions (e.g. Do you believe in God?) and to allow researchers to make more accurate population level estimates of socially sensitive phenomena (e.g.  the prevalence of atheism). ",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Nationally representative telephone polls are probably biased when it comes to socially sensitive questions, including belief in God. Answers reflect both actual beliefs and also tendencies to consciously or unconsciously give the “right” (nice, friendly, socially acceptable) answer. One school of thought says that we should turn away from self-reports and try to develop implicit measures of cognition. Another school of thought says that we can still ask people about their beliefs, but we should do so in a way that gives people an “out,” by which they can tell us about their beliefs in an indirect way, with pressures to appear socially desirable somewhat mitigated."
Methodological challenges in conducting research on irreligious Tunisians,Yosr Ben Slima,King's College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will examine the methodological difficulties related to the study of the nonreligion phenomenon within Tunisia (a Muslim-majority country). I argue that the problem stems from the difficulty of defining and locating nonreligion, especially in the absence of any forms of organization. Certain material manifestations of nonreligion can be signs of unorthodox Islam rather than material signs of nonreligion ,while abidance by some Islamic rituals is not necessarily a sign of piety and belief. I propose the neologism 'practicing irreligious Tunisians’ to refer to irreligious individuals who consciously choose to continue performing Islamic rituals. Abiding by certain Islamic rituals has become for these irreligious Tunisians living with traditional Muslim families, a manner to develop more empathy, by refusing to inflict pain on their beloved ones. This moral consideration is shaped by what these irreligious Tunisians refer to as 'humane values’ or in a more ironic manner ' ethics of Kofar’2 . The methodological challenge resides in distinguising between unorthodoxy and nonreligion .Who is a real irreligious Tunisian ? To understand the subversive nature of the irreligious performance of Islamic rituals , I rely on the virtual sphere which presents an outlet used by many irreligious Tunisians to express their 'authentic selves’. I combine both virtual ethnography and long-term relationships with irreligious Tunisians to explore nonreligion in a context where the fear of social rejection and the ambivalence of the legal system vis-à-vis nonreligious Tunisians make it difficult to openly approach the subject in the public sphere.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

Using survey data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we speak to current debates concerning potential relationships between religion, nonreligion and health in older adult populations with two key findings. First, we show no consistent relationships between religion or nonreligion and chronic condition prevalence. Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i.e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing intersectional approaches to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.

In this post, Alexandros Sakellariou explores this question by examining Greek atheists. His analysis shows that Greek atheists choose to be atheists as a result of breaking the chains of religious memory. At first, formation of their atheist identity is largely to reject their Orthodox identity, but Greek atheists gradually find their own positive identity with atheist beliefs and morality.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The outcome of my research is that Greek atheists having brought up as Greek Orthodox Christians decided to break this chain of religious memory and change their ethnic nominal Orthodox identity at some point of their life course following a variety of paths. However, as it came out, after an initial stage of rejecting their Orthodox identity they gave moved towards a positive formation of an atheist identity. This means that the vast majority of them reflected on a number of issues, particularly life meaning and morality, building this way a distinct atheist identity which is not any more identified exclusively with anti-Orthodox attitudes. It is not easy to argue whether there are more atheists in Greece now, or that they have started to speak out, or both. The truth is that atheism in Greece is still in its infancy compared with other western societies and which also applies to its scientific study."
Has God Really Returned to Eastern Europe?,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A recent Washington Times editorial proclaimed “God Returns to Eastern Europe”. In this media response blog, Atko Remmel addresses the problems with survey questions, the conflation of terminology and how we measure religion to analyse if God really has returned to Eastern Europe.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Referring to a Pew Research Center study “Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe”, a recent Washington Times editorial rejoices about the resurgence of religion in Eastern Europe, titling the text “God returns to Eastern Europe”. The message is simple: godless Commies failed and religion is back, prospering again much as it did a hundred years ago. At first glance, the data presented in the article seems to support this understanding: 86% of Russians ascribe to some variant of religious belief and 44% of Russians claim to be “quite religious”. Moreover, the percentage of atheists has dropped by half from 26 to 13% in last three years. While it is definitely true that religion in post-Soviet society is in a much better position than during the project of “forced secularization” (Froese 2004), the author(s) of the editorial may have got some things wrong and missed some important points. First of all, although the editorial claims to rely on Pew study, some of the data seem to originate from Levada Center’s (Russian counterpart of the Pew Research Center) recent survey on religiosity in Russia (report in Russian), mediated to Anglophone readers by Breitbart News – during which some things have been clearly lost in translation. For instance, looking at the original Levada report, 44% of “quite religious” Russians turn out to be “somewhat religious” and only 9% describe themselves as “very religious”. In sum, only about half of the population considers themselves more or less “religious”. Regarding the diminishing percentage of atheists, Levada data actually indicate a noticeable change (which instantly arises suspicion) among those, who said they are “totally irreligious”."
The Sacred Structure of Doubt: Reflections on Christ-Haunted Atheism,Ben Wood,University of Chester,Wales,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ben Wood considers the ways in which our Western secular culture is still 'haunted’ by the Christian story. And like an unruly ghost, this narrative presence refuses to rest, producing the peculiar contradiction of faithful unbelief– in art, philosophy, and literature.  Yet, in the midst of this cultural paradox, there exists a stirring coherence.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Contemporary discussions of religious belief in the media are frequently conducted through the unaccommodating lenses of binary thinking. Either we either 'believe in God’ or we disbelieve. A religious story either makes sense to us or else we are baffled. What is perhaps less talked about however, are the so-called marginal cases where unbelief owes its structure and vitality to faith. So obsessed is our culture with 'the fundamentalist’ and the 'true believer’ that we rarely consider the religious life of the doubter. Such oversight is examined with verve and colour in Simon Critchley’s book Faith of the Faithless. Here the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde is described as one living a religiously ambiguous life. Neither straightforwardly Christian nor flatly apostate, Wilde’s sense of the sacred is continually mediated through the beauties of art, iconography and scripture. Such an aesthetic sensibility is forever slippery, neither rejecting Christianity nor fully embracing it. As Critchley suggests, this is 'the faith of the faithless and the belief of unbelievers, a faith which does not give up the idea of truth, but reinterprets it.’"

While a spoof in some respects, the followers point out that nothing is inherently sacred and that sacredness is simply whatever a group of people choose to deem sacred. Religion has traditionally been centered on belief in a powerful supernatural being which is turned to by believers for answers to difficult questions about the purpose of life and for support and good fortune in major endeavors, such as war. However, Christianity has been on the wane for decades in the U.S. and Europe. Theologian John Shelby Spong has challenged Christians, in order to revive their faith, to redefine God in non-theistic terms, not as a human-like being but as an abstract concept around which to focus one’s life."

Albania was funded as a multi-religious country. The political elites considered religion, particularly Islam, an impediment to national unity and progress. The inhabitants were urged to ignore religious differences, and the first Constitution (1922) established that 'the state does not have any official religion’. In 1990, the last year of communist rule, religion was legalised. A myriad of Muslim and Christian traditions resurfaced, and Albanians of different religious persuasions celebrated their newborn freedom. Surveys indicate that secularism, religious freedom and equality have strong popular support. The statistics give us an idea about sociological aspects, but say less about “lived religion” and individualised systems of meaning. "

In this blog, Cees Tulp details explorative research that offers an empirical instrument to measure hope – 'the Hope Barometer’.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"This project entails explorative research to hope from different disciplines to gain conceptual clarity. Because hope is as complex and ambiguous as the human person himself or herself, it requires interdisciplinary investigation.

One of the stimuli has been an academic conference entitled “Driven by Hope: Economics and Theology in Dialogue,” which took place in February 2017 at the Evangelical Theological Faculty in Leuven. The second phase of the project seeks to give more insight into the empirical relation between hope and happiness. Besides literature study, an empirical instrument to measure hope has been developed called the Hope Barometer. It is the most complete instrument developed until now to measure hope. In contrast to other instruments to measure hope, the Hope Barometer distinguishes seven different dimensions of hope (thought, emotion, virtue, social hope, economic expectation, institutional trust and spiritual hope)."
"For Atheists in the United States, the Personal is Political",Evan Stewart,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Evan Stewart uses survey data in his research to investigate the differences between non-belief and atheist identification. Evan finds that belief in evolution and education are not significant predictors of atheist identification when we control for political views.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Last year I published a review article laying out some of the challenges for studying atheism, particularly in the United States. We know that anti-atheist sentiment in the U.S. is persistent and durable, and that atheists do a lot of collective work to build a common sense of identity. As a result, my work argues that we have to carefully distinguish non-belief in god from atheist self-identification, since self-identification signals far more than non-belief alone. Choosing to call oneself an atheist in the United States means navigating stigma, community affinities, and relationships to authority, and it can therefore become a shortcut for a range of assumptions about matters of public concern. I used survey data to investigate the differences between non-belief and atheist self-identification, but the original analysis from the review article was not conclusive. Most surveys, even those that can measure (non)religion in detail, cannot get a large enough subsample of atheists to make strong claims. The study of nonreligion is developing into a robust field, drawing interest from across the social sciences and humanities. As it continues to grow, researchers who work in this area will continue to face questions about whether their findings are generalizable across different groups and whether they replicate in different social contexts. Luckily, new data have become publicly available that allow for a conceptual replication."

Yet this view places religion and secularism into a binary relationship with each other, despite the scholarly efforts to demonstrate that this binary is the result of a particular Christian cultural-historical trajectory. The religion/secular binary is subsequently reflected in a series of related modern binaries, such as religion/politics; private/public, which are primarily ideological rather than having a basis in lived experience. The lived experience of Bengali Muslims revolves around dharma, a vernacular category that pushes through a religious/secular binary. My ethnographic exploration of Bengali Muslims’ understanding of dharma therefore provokes an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between religion, secularism and politics."
No religion really is the new religion,Hugh Rock,Independent scholar,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Linda Woodhead’s recent work has argued that 'no religion is the new religion’. In this blog, Hugh Rock asks whether is it now high time that the sociology of religion takes this suggestion much more seriously?",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Linda Woodhead’s address to this year’s EASR conference in Helsinki titled 'No Religion is the New Religion’ was, for me, distinctly thought provoking. As a rebellious theologian, I take that title to be literally true. But despite the implication, Woodhead was not theorising 'no religion’ as religion. What struck me about the disjunction between my conclusion about no religion and Woodhead’s hiatus, was that the title presages a potential conceptual advance that remains something of an obstacle because we have not quite completed the conceptual armoury needed to get round it; but that such an advance would be fertile in connecting up the wave of empirical studies of the non-religious, such as Woodhead, Lois Lee and many others have been engaging, with new work theorising the nonreligious. To summarize the result of this theorising, the category 'no religion’ for me comprises a raft of world-building, life-meaning-making endeavours, within the framework of a naturalistic worldview, that are sociologically indistinguishable from the world-building, life-orientating endeavours carried out within the framework of a theistic worldview. Therefore, I see in 'non-religion’ a spectrum of new naturalistic religions."
Institutional Confidence in the United States: Attitudes of Secular Americans,Isabella Kasselstrand,"California State University, Bakersfield",California,F,Tiana Couse,Colorado Mesa University,Colorado,F,Shanell Sanchez,Southern Oregon University,Oregon,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The First Amendment to the United States’ Constitution addresses freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995–2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions. Based on previous literature and the empirical evidence presented in this study, we argue that overall lower levels of institutional confidence among secular Americans is an outcome of the exclusion of such individuals from American social life. Thus, it highlights the importance of addressing the stereotypes and prejudice that this minority group faces.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.,.
There is a Sexular Body: Introducing a Material Approach to the Secular,Jelle Wiering,University of Groningen,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article calls for more 'bottom-up inquiry’ into the secular, departing from the assumption that it features normative ideologies and practices that dominate current societies. I plea for collecting and analyzing manifestations of the secular, as the secular as an phenomenon in society is surprisingly unexplored. To stimulate such inquiry, I suggest a material approach to the secular, as it will provide researchers with tools to conduct empirical research on the secular in contemporary societies. Inspired by Joan Scott, Charles Hirschkind, and Talal Asad, this article explores the notion of a Dutch 'sexular’ body: a body which affective-gestural repertoires, limited here to the context of sexuality, people in society (historically) associate with the secular. I conclude by arguing that a material approach to the secular will contribute to (1) obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the secular, including its cultural conceptualizations and manifestations, and (2) clarifying, and hence facing the normativity the secular imposes on the people living in secular societies.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.,.

Below, he charts some of the most provocative questions coming out of those sessions, whose as-yet-unknown answers might steer where our knowledge of Canadian nones goes next.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"This monograph is based on face-to-face interviews with three groups of Canadians: 30 active religious affiliates (identify with a Christian group and attend religious services nearly every week), 30 marginal religious affiliates (identify with a Christian group and attend religious services mainly for religious holidays and rites of passage), and 30 religious nones (do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services). Contrary to rational choice theorists who contend that there is ongoing demand for the things that religious groups offer (e.g. meaning and purpose in life, life after death), I question the assumption that if we simply adjust religious supply (e.g. better music or preaching, more programming, or more liberal theology) we should expect increased involvement in institutionalized forms of religious life. Further, I develop how and why I think secularization theory remains useful for describing and explaining religious belief and practice in Canada."
Whither the Paranormal in Secular Studies?,Joseph O. Baker,East Tennessee State University,Tennessee,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Joseph O. Baker encourages the study of nonreligion to look beyond the study of atheists and skeptics, and explore what he calls the doubly castoff, the supernatural.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In our rush to study secularities empirically, we have made great progress on examining topics such as atheism, particularly in terms of ideology and social movements, as organized communities, patterns of psychological dispositions, and more generally as a culturally constructed yet socially relevant category. Considering how little research there was of this kind a decade ago, these are indeed encouraging signs of vitality.  But other dimensions within the broader umbrella of “nonreligion” have gone unexplored. For example, despite an expanded understanding of the social psychologies of supernatural disbelief, spirits still haunt secular studies just out of sight (or off the page), much as they do religious studies and the social sciences more generally—particularly psychology.  That is to say, secular studies is in no way alone in ignoring—or in the case of organized skeptic groups, condemning—the paranormal.  Indeed, the paranormal is, by definition, the doubly damned castoff of both organized religions and secular scientism. Yet damnation doesn’t make the paranormal go away.  It always returns."
Belonging Without Believing?,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"New research reports that 53% of the British public now describe themselves as having “no religion”. In this media response blog, Josh Bullock comments on his research on the Sunday Assembly London in this post-Christian transition.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Generational Y (born after 1980 and sometimes referred to as 'Millennials’) trends towards nonreligion in the UK have allowed the Sunday Assembly — a secular community that uses existing religious structures, rituals and practices — to flourish. It is through this post-Christian transition and religion as a chain of memory that people are still seeking to belong, but do not wish to believe in a religious doctrine. It is this current transitional phase that has provided the correct conditions for the Sunday Assembly to take flight as an idea and global congregational movement. Clichéd as it may sound, the world was not ready for the Sunday Assembly even as recent as 25 years ago — simply put, it would not have served a purpose or fulfilled a niche. However, with the dawn of the new millennium, then post-9/11, post-new-atheism, and the decline of Christianity in the UK, the Sunday Assembly could thrive as a 'half-way house’ for those leaving their religion and those who had never been religious, but who sought what religious communities had to exclusively offer. What becomes apparent is a need to not completely cast out Christianity and its rituals and traditions."

The number of Australians reporting no religion has continued to rise steadily at about 3.9 percentage points per decade; the decade between 2001 and 2011 saw the largest increase at 6.8 percentage points.

Specifically, scholars of nonreligion should begin analyzing transgender nonreligious people’s experiences in religious settings, with family, and with organizations and networks outside of religion.

Using a jurisdictional scan, focus groups, and an on-line survey, this exploratory survey examines the provision for and use of secular legal marriage in Canada’s regions from a humanist perspective. It is postulated that marriage ceremonies have persisted among the non-religious due to needs to authenticate or recognize transitional changes to the self, but these needs have been met through ad hoc strategies as opposed to a uniform demand for humanist services. Implications for humanist organizations are discussed along with recommendations for further research.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.,.
Reframing Assisted Dying: Nonreligion and the Law,Lori Beaman,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Law and religion frequently interact, sometimes as a matter of challenging religion’s reach into public spaces, sometimes as a matter of reentrenching majority religion. But what about nonreligion and the law? In this piece, Lori G. Beaman argues that subtle shifts in legal approaches can be revealing of the often mysterious contents of nonreligion. Specifically, she asks: what could a nonreligious approach to assisted dying law look like?",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"There are two challenges that are preoccupying me in my research on nonreligion: first, how to think about nonreligion without being pulled into the “like religion but…” vortex and second, how to study this emerging reality. One such site is in law. This is especially so on the issue of assisted death. The Supreme Court of Canada permits interveners to make submissions when it is hearing a case of public importance. In Carter there were 26 interveners, 12 of them religious. One of those was in favour of the idea of establishing an assisted dying regime. The rest were opposed. They used language like “suicide” and used the word “death” rather than “dying”, while nonreligious interveners used terms such as “end-of-life decisions”; “assisted dying”; “medically assisted dying”; “self-chosen death”. Nonreligious interveners framed their understanding of dying as including the possibility of a “good death”, which respected the wishes of the individual and preserved dignity. The point here is that the facta reveal distinctly different approaches that illuminate what we might describe as a nonreligious approach to this issue, or, the dark matter of nonreligion, to return to that metaphor."

As a non-religious healthcare chaplain myself whose main responsibility is the provision of spiritual care to non-religious patients, I have faced some challenges when discussing and implementing secular spiritual care in a hospital environment. In the recent blog, Watts argues that scholars of spirituality must make a distinction between the study for spirituality (understanding spirituality’s practical application) and the study of spirituality (describing spirituality in a specific context). One of the challenges I face as a non-religious chaplain is managing both of these approaches to studying spirituality in a secular and medical based institution."

It will select and analyse contemporary controversial cases from public debates about religion, gender and sexuality. Of central importance to this project is the assumption that public debates predominantly constitute secular discourses about religion, gender and sexuality that emphasise women’s equality and sexual freedom. An analysis of controversies in public debates, therefore, reveals secular normative understandings about women’s emancipation and the presuppositions underlying them. A second assumption is that these understandings about women’s emancipation are constituted partly through scrutinising and critiquing the norms, positions and roles laid out for women in monotheistic religious traditions and communities. Secular normative statements about women’s equality and emancipation can, therefore, be studied as 'identity markers’ over and against religious communities. By studying current controversies in public debates, the project aims to clarify secular discourses which women converting to different religious traditions in West-European contexts have to negotiate."

This gap between narratives, perceptions, and knowledge was part of the motivation for the current Science and Religion: Exploring the Spectrum project. Given that the US is already the most researched country and a distinctively polarized one in terms of science and religion debates, we chose to focus upon two cognate and yet contrasting national contexts: Canada and the UK. The multidisciplinary, multi-sited team has been conducting qualitative sociological, historical, psychological, and survey research in both countries. We also decided to concentrate upon the relationship between evolution and religion, because this has become a focal point for wider science and religion debates."

We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were religious identities, with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non)religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” religious identities, unless those religious identities are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.

What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past?

Utilizing an intersectional lens, I conclude that lessons of the Christian home, reinforced in religious school and at church, drew a connection between Christianity, one’s racial and ethnic identity, and heterosexuality in such a way that being LGBTQ was marked un-Christian and foreign, and sometimes associated with whiteness. This further shaped how my participants navigated the urban public sphere, one of the only spheres where they could 'be LGBTQ’ – some neighborhoods were constructed as Christian, connected to one’s childhood and hostile to LGBTQ people, while others were LGBTQ-friendly, albeit largely white and gentrified. The overall impact of Christianity across multiple spheres influenced which non-religious paths my participants took. One remained with a Christian denomination of her childhood and one remained with a Christian denomination of her mother but not her father. The other eight left Christianity behind, with one choosing a different religion and seven becoming non-religious, holding identities from Unitarian Universalist to atheist. Overall, black LGBTQ people struggle to find acceptance of their LGBTQ identities by people closest to them and acceptance of their racial, ethnic and non-religious identities in largely white and often non-religious LGBTQ spaces.

This has reached the point that many of us get anxious even discussing the holiday with colleagues: “what are you doing for…Christmas? Winter break?

Although several suggestions have been made, I think we can most effectively capture the range of things we want to study by (1) adopting worldviews, defined in terms of “big questions,” as an overarching rubric that encompasses both religious and nonreligious outlooks and (2) nuancing our understanding of worldviews in light of the meaning systems (MS) framework, already in use in psychology. Doing so relieves scholars of the obligation of defining religion and nonreligion and allows us to focus on how individuals and groups characterize themselves. It provides a neutral starting point for analyzing worldviews that is not biased toward religion, and, in so far as a case can be made that all humans must address these questions at least implicitly, it offers a basis for comparison across cultures. The so-called “existentially indifferent” provide a challenge in this regard and allow us to consider the value of an evolutionary perspective on meaning making.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion,.
"“A Swedish Voltaire” The Life and Afterlife of Ingemar Hedenius, 20th-Century Atheist",Anton Jansson,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ingemar Hedenius (1908–1982) was a professor of philosophy, and one of Sweden’s most famous public intellectuals in the decades following the Second World War. This was primarily due to his 1949 work Tro och vetande (English: Belief and Knowledge) in which he criticized religion, and his subsequent activity in the promotion of atheism and criticism of the relationship between church and state. This article engages with Hedenius’s life and works, but has a particular focus on his “afterlife”. The article utilizes theories of cultural memory to examine how Hedenius has been remembered since his death. I argue that Hedenius and his Tro och vetande in Sweden have taken the role of a node, or inescapable orientation point, of discussions of atheism, belief and knowledge, and the validity of Christian truths. Hedenius’s memory continues to loom large over religion and nonreligion in Sweden to this day.

Strategies of 'reflexive secularization’ were used to spread religious values in society through their recategorization within secular fields, allowing practitioners to partially convey the teachings and provide spiritual guidance in the form of ethical norms of behaviour. These strategies, however, seemed bound to result in a compromised negotiation: the need to detach these concepts from their religious foundations undermined the value and perceived effectiveness of missionary practice. This was stressed by Nekoda, who pinpointed a difference in “depth” (fukasa) between religion and ethics. The process of negotiation, moreover, was not unidirectional: the need to comply with constraints informing the domain of social welfare and care in Japan led practitioners to adopt a more fluid conception of missionary practice, which prioritised spreading Kōseikai values and “teaching a way of living” over the acquisition of new converts. The case of Kōseikai shows how negotiating “religion” in public spaces in Japan turns into a multidirectional process, not limited to the transmission of religious concepts and practices in nonreligious terms, but also shaping members’ own interpretation and implementation of religious practice."
Sacred Traditions in Secular Britain – What plans for the next coronation reveal about the relationship between religion and tradition,Charlotte Hobson,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog post, Charlotte Hobson explores British sentiments around the sacred using the Monarchy as a case study, asking: who wants a Christian coronation?",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The word sacred is often associated with religion but its use need not be limited in this way. Sacred values come in many forms – two common examples are the notions of equality or justice. They are non-negotiable and fundamental to an individual’s world view and way of life, causing dispute and disruption when threatened or challenged. In this blog I will explore the idea that traditions are held sacred in British society, with reference to attitudes concerning a modern-day coronation ceremony and its contents. On the basis of a small qualitative research project, I propose that the public’s desire to retain explicitly Christian traditions and rituals in the next coronation – despite declining levels of religiosity – is evidence of widespread reverence for sacred tradition rather than, ironically, sacred religion"

Activist Unbelief in Canadian History,Elliot Hanowski,Independent scholar,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Canada has a long history of religious unbelief. This paper offers a social historical survey of its organized, activist forms. The radical thought of the Enlightenment was imported in the late eighteenth century, which saw Voltairean deists like Fleury Mesplet criticizing the Catholic Church in the French-speaking colony of Lower Canada. A long tradition of anticlericalism followed in Quebec even though (or because) the Church was massively influential. The rest of Canada saw freethought and rationalist movements, often organized by working-class autodidacts, developing in the nineteenth century with American and British influences. This tradition continued into the first half of the twentieth century when secularists grappled with fundamentalism and the challenge of radical politics. After World War II the language of secular humanism was deployed and organizations were run by highly educated professionals instead. The position of activist unbelief began to change as Canada shifted from being one of the Western world’s most religious countries to being one of the least in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unbelief became unremarkable, though the persistence of religion meant that the twenty-first century saw a revival of militant atheism. This survey shows that unbelief was never just a pure philosophical position but has always been shaped by the social status quo it evolved in or was opposing. Nor was opposition ever enough; activist unbelievers inevitably had to offer the undecided a vision of the secular world they were working towards, and this meant getting involved in some form of politics.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

Silva,Georgia Southern University,Georgia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article explores how atheism, literalism, and non-literalism are validated and stigmatized in public discourse over evolutionary theory. Through an ethnographic content analysis of 1,028 letters to the editor, I examine how authors frame the relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and religious faith. I find there are four ways of doing so: 1) implicit polarization, obliquely denies any compatibility between religion and evolution; 2) distancing, separates one’s position from that of another; 3) articulation, weaves evolution and faith together; and 4) combinations of polarization, distancing, and articulation. Each framing results in some mixture of stigmatization and validation of atheism, literalism, and non-literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes and validates atheism and literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes non-literalism through unacknowledgment. Distancing can validate and stigmatize literalism and non-literalism, while it also results in literalism and atheism being stigmatized by putative allies. Articulation validates non-literalism by representing it in the public sphere and it stigmatizes atheism and literalism through unacknowledgment.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.

Drawing from his qualitative research with Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR he argues that individuals who claim “spirituality” do so largely as a result of the religious imaginaries they hold. Thus investigating the nature of these imaginaries might prove far more fruitful than obsessing over whether or notspirituality is “real religion” or not.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"I want to consider the oft-posed question as regards spirituality: is it secular or religious? My thinking about this topic was spurred by reading Steve Bruce’s The Secular Beats the Spiritual, published last year. According to Bruce, the increased interest in “spirituality” as distinct from “religion”—evidenced by a number of polls that show the number of North Americans and Britons who identify as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR) has increased over the last two decades—does not repudiate the secularization thesis, but rather confirms it. Based on my research findings it would seem that individuals who claim “spirituality” (as well as those who reject it) do so largely as a result of the religious imaginary they hold. Like Bruce, my study participants hold their own conceptions of “religion” which inform how they define “spirituality.” Drawing attention to these varying religious imaginaries, I argue, is important, because they illuminate how individuals operationalize the “spiritual but not religious” discourse in distinct ways and for different (sometimes competing) purposes. Bruce’s substantive definition of “religion” is helpful in answering a particular kind of question, but it fails in aiding us to capture the richness of and diversity of the religious (and spiritual) imaginaries alive in Western society today. In turn, we must not stop at the question: Is spirituality secular or religious? but also ask: Who is asking?, Who is answering? and What are the reasons they are giving?"
Social Imaginaries in a Globalizing World,Hans Alma,Utrecht University,Netherlands,M,Guido Vanheeswijck,University of Antwerp,Belgium,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How to study the contemporary dynamics between the religious, the nonreligious and the secular in a globalizing world? Obviously, their relationship is not an empirical datum, liable to the procedures of verification or of logical deduction. We are in need of alternative conceptual and methodological tools. This volume argues that the concept of 'social imaginary’ as it is used by Charles Taylor, is of utmost importance as a methodological tool to understand these dynamics. The first section is dedicated to the conceptual clarification of Taylor’s notion of social imaginaries both through a historical study of their genealogy and through conceptual analysis. In the second section, we clarify the relation of 'social imaginaries’ to the concept of (religious) worldviewing, understood as a process of truth seeking. Furthermore, we discuss the practical usefulness of the concept of social imaginaries for cultural scientists, by focusing on the concept of human rights as a secular social imaginary. In the third and final section, we relate Taylor’s view on the role of social imaginaries and the new paths it opens up for religious studies to other analyses of the secular-religious divide, as they nowadays mainly come to the fore in the debates on what is coined as the 'post-secular.’",2018,Book,"Religion and its others: Studies in Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity",.,.,.

While this involvement has primarily been with non-religion as the unregulated, tolerated or persecuted wilderness beyond the pristine garden of religious belief, items that can be categorized as “non-religion” have also increasingly become subject to legal regulation in their own right. Despite this long-lasting relationship, research on non-religion and law is virtually non-existent. This is despite the boom in scholarship on both law and religion and non-religion, with new journals, research networks, study programs and research centers being established at a rapid pace. So far, there has been little interest in the history and impact of the many different ways in which law and legal regulations have been involved in the construction, maintenance and negotiation of the boundaries of non-religion."

Being a religious none refers to not belonging to any religious group or tradition. In other words, nones share in common their non-belonging. Although nones typically find themselves closer to the non-religious end of the continuum on all its dimensions, recent literature highlights diverse beliefs and practices among nones such that we might think of nones at various distances from that pole. For example, attention has been given to those who “believe without belonging”, are “spiritual but not religious”, or who are actively involved in atheist, humanist, or secular organizations."

And while it remains an open question whether or not the research assumptions and theoretical frameworks designed for Western populations of Protestants can be applied to non-believers, exploring non-belief in the Islamic context may pose additional problems. For example, do Western concepts and terms such as “church attendance” or “atheist” have equivalent meaning in the Muslim world? Are there any structural differences within Islam and Christianity that may contribute to the uneven number of self-reported non-believers within these cultures?

Sovereign of Herself: Women’s Narratives of 'Lived Atheism’,Marta Trzebiatowska,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In most western societies the number of female non-believers is growing and atheism has become one manifestation of nonreligion among many (Pew Forum, 2015). However, little is known about female atheists. This article fills the gap by providing the voices of a small percentage of women who consider themselves 'practising’ but not 'active’ atheists. Through a sociological analysis of qualitative interviews with twenty self-identified atheist women I argue for the importance of researching the mundane aspects of female atheism which often fall under the radar when scholars focus predominantly on the vocal and politically active atheists. 'Lived atheism’ comprises small and seemingly insignificant actions and utterances which structure atheist women’s lives and contribute to the creation of new worldviews, symbols, and reflexive strategies. Micro-actions triggered by religious content, symbols and utterances, found in the nominally secular fabric of everyday life, add up to novel forms of gendered agency which is markedly different to outspoken activist atheism, and yet not the same as agnosticism, pure indifference, or 'none-ism’. By examining 'atheist flashpoints’ – moments when dormant atheist convictions come to the surface – I demonstrate how women practice 'everyday atheism’ as they navigate personal and public spaces.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.
Increased Wellbeing from Social Interaction in a Secular Congregation,Michael E. Price,Brunel University London,England,M,Jacques Launay,Brunel University London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Religiosity appears to benefit wellbeing, potentially due to social support offered by religious communities. However, rising secularism implies that fewer people have access to these benefits. To address this problem, we investigated whether these benefits could also be obtained from membership in a secular, quasi-religious community. We conducted a longitudinal study among 92 members of the Sunday Assembly (SA), an international organization of secular congregations. SA members assemble in large services and in smaller interest groups that offer more face-to-face interaction. Once a month for six months, participants completed a questionnaire measuring wellbeing and participation in both SA and non-SA social activities. Panel analysis of longitudinal data revealed that participation in SA small-group activities positively influenced wellbeing over the six-month period, particularly among males. Participation in non-SA social activities, in contrast, had no effect on wellbeing. Aspects of the Sunday service that members perceived as most important, both for creating a sense of community and for friendship formation, were the informal socialising and cooperating that occurs before and after the service itself. Secular congregations may be a viable alternative for non-religious people (and perhaps especially men) who seek the health benefits that religious communities have traditionally offered.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.

This was soon followed by the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which represents the beginning of the modern era in Japan. It was during the early years of the Meiji era (1868-1912) when 'religion’ was gradually understood and translated into Japanese in a definitive way  2003.

They reject traditional religious institutions and they walk their own spiritual way."
An Argument for Unbelief: A Discussion about Terminology,Nickolas Garth Conrad,University of California at Santa Cruz,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The rupture with traditional religion and the loss of belief in God as a widespread religious position represents a sea change in Western thought. However, there were very few self-declared atheists, secularists, and humanists in Western history prior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even during the Modern period, there are not many. This is especially true in my own research of nineteenth and early twentieth-century France. Those who took the name of atheist such as Baron d’Holbach or Jacques-André Naigeon were exceptional militants. The quest to find other such atheists buried in the pages and hidden messages of key books is a limited endeavor. Atheism as a concept does not originate from any single creed or doctrine and is itself open to permutation. Looking for a clear and distinct form of atheism is looking for a conceptual phenomenon constructed by the researcher. The language and words we use control and direct how we understand the past. The term “atheist” imposes a rigidity to a fluid and shifting phenomenon. Instead, we should open up our research to the emergence of modern “unbelief,” as defined by Gordon Stein and Tom Flynn in The Encyclopedia of Unbelief. This paper will argue for “unbelief” as the proper analytical category as a field of future research that will allow for a much larger, more inclusive, variegated set of parameters to understand the rupture with traditional forms of religion or spiritual practices. The important change in intellectual history was not the emergence of a particular atheism that promoted scientism and which held to its positions dogmatically but the acute doubt of past intellectual and religious traditions that led to a spectrum of new ideologies and religious positions.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

Our interviews with traditionalist Jewish and Muslim women seeking divorces in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, challenge and complexify many of the assumptions that undergird each of the aforementioned theoretical schools.

Sacred beyond religion: cultivation of individuality in post-Christendom,Polina Batanova,Abo Akademi University,Finland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, doctoral student Polina Batanova discusses the enduring relevance of the classic work of sociologist Emile Durkheim to the study of nonreligion. She argues his functionalist definition of religion, which emphasizes the fundamental importance of sacred forms, helps to illuminate the nature of “religion” in secular modern societies—that being, the cult of the individual. Tracing its genealogy through liberalism and back to the Reformation, and offering contemporary examples to demonstrate its prevalence in modern societies, Batanova makes a powerful case for thinking the sacralization of the “individual” may be the quintessential sacred form in modernity.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In line with Durkheim’s thesis that in traditional society all sacred ideas are represented by religion while in modern society sacred forms transcend religious contexts, I propose to talk about the traditional/modern distinction in the terms religious/post-religious.

In short, sacred forms still exist in our modern secularized world, but in order to spot them, we must refuse always identifying the sacred with religion."

Rather than trying to think them through the somewhat mystifying entity of “the secular”, he suggests that they may be understood in a clearer way as different shapes of the relationship between humans and God. Some of these shapes  correspond with a binary model that juxtapose Islamic and secular-liberal traditions as distinct, mutually external regimes; and some of them do not. Schielke proposes to add to the theme of secularism a more complex landscape of heresies and imaginative explorations that either unsettle a tradition from within, or have different concerns altogether.",2018,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.
Yamagata Bantō: An Atheist in the Tokugawa Period,Shuhei Fujii,University of Tokyo,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the atheistic thought of Yamagata Bantō (1748–1821). The general concept of atheism will also be discussed. The term “atheism” is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Bantō, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603–1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Bantō denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Bantō, gods were a “skillful means” created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Bantō believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Bantō, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Bantō’s “no gods” argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Bantō is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Bantō will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of “atheism” and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

But what about the positive role that myths play in underwriting shared action?

The following is a short introduction to that book. ",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"'Myth’ is a term widely used but rarely defined. It’s employed regularly among journalists and politicians as a euphemism for 'lies,’ such as in the New Yorker’s recent headline, “Mueller’s Indictment Ends Trump Myth of the Russia 'Hoax’.” Just as commonly, myth is used to denote not outright lies, but the basing of broader narratives in prominent, but not statistically significant, events. This usage is employed by social progressives and conservatives alike, such as the myth of the Muslim terrorist or the myth of white privilege. In these cases, the use of myth is associated with the rise of grassroots media. Yet another usage of myth regards religious narratives: in this case, it is the events themselves, rather than their statistical significance that is called into question. Here myth is cast as an age-old problem yet to be removed from the modern psyche. Ill-defined as they are, these usages share a common thread: myths are dangerous, sometimes pernicious things that go against key principles on which modernity is founded."

In recent years a growing secular movement has been occurring within AA that has prompted an increasing number of secular meeting groups to organize. This trend has seen significant growth since the early 2010s, supported largely through online networking websites such as AA Agnostica, AA Beyond Belief, and Secular AA.

Religious vs cultural? Some findings about the unexpected dichotomy,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When discussing their visits to the churches, a number of my nonreligious informants from Estonia have mentioned that their interest is not 'religious’, but 'cultural’. I have also noticed a similar tendency at conferences – while not directly opposing the two, some colleagues talk of religion and culture as separate entities. Both examples tell us quite a lot about how 'culture’ is perceived – in this context it’s actual meaning seems to be 'secular’ – or, at least, it has strong connotation with 'not religious’. Based on my findings from Estonian media and interviews with nonreligious informants, the paper explores the possibility of studying the essence of nonreligion via the mutual relationships of 'religion’, 'culture’ and 'nonreligion’. Particular attention is paid to the changes in the meanings of 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ words and their connotations.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Seeking Cultural Change in the Reproduction of Intolerance: Secularism, Islamism and 'others’ in Turkey’s experience of democratization,Metin Koca,European University Institute,Italy,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite long-term efforts to explain the universal and the regional patterns of democratization, little has been achieved in understanding the individual experience of societies with these patterns. A particular cultural element has been recognized in the democratization literature, but the focal point of this study of 'culture’ has not been change but persistence. With a methodology that brings together agency, time and social context, this study aims at grasping cultural change in, firstly what has been perceived on the field as a continuity (i.e. settled cultural processes), and secondly what has been consciously recognized as a process of change (i.e. unsettled cultural processes). Focusing on the interrelationship of these cultural processes, I problematize the polarization between secularism(s), Islamism(s) and their 'others’, which has arguably been the deepest ideological struggle behind the core questions of coexistence in the history of Turkey’s democratization. By analyzing a selection of conversational texts from three fields that signify a reproduction of intolerance—these fields are 'Alevis and funerals’, 'women and clothing’, and 'LGBT and show business’—I will argue that Turkey has recently faced some unprecedented questions of tolerance, which includes new approaches to the politics of recognition, difference and negative tolerance. In conclusion, the study will touch upon the ways to examine 'settled’ and 'unsettled’ cultural processes, the re-making of secularism in Turkey, and the differentiated meanings of the concept of tolerance in this period.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Mediating 'Religious’ and 'Non-Religious’ Spaces: A Cultural Expression of a Japanese Religion in Postwar France,Masato Kato,SOAS University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will explore the roles that cultural representations can play in mediating the 'religious’ and 'non-religious’ spaces through the case of a Japanese religion operating in postwar France. Boundaries between religious and non-religious spaces are often contested and negotiated by relevant social actors and institutions, as evinced by recent scholarship on religions in the public sphere. Not much has been discussed so far, however, as to how representations and institutional activities associated with a certain culture can mediate the two spaces by translating the religious representations and messages into the cultural counterparts. To highlight this dynamic, this paper will highlight the case of a Japanese religion known as Tenrikyō as it operates in postwar France. Tenrikyō’s propagation in France is characterised by its two-tier yet legally separate institutional structure involving 'religious’ and 'cultural’ associations—an institutional demarcation necessitated by the French legal framework relating to the 1901 and 1905 laws. In the course of promoting cultural activities as a way to increase the visibility and legitimacy of the name Tenri in the French public, Tenrikyō has at times the reinterpretation process but is not a sufficient explanation for the radical used representations and activities associated with Japan in ways that allow messages and representations that are otherwise confined to religious spaces to go beyond the boundaries thereof. By exploring the case of Tenrikyō in France, this paper will consider the implications and limitations of using cultural resources to present a religious tradition in a non-religious space.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Reinterpreting sacred experiences: Examining how exposure to global and historical diversity can transform an individual's meaning system,James Murphy,South Dakota State University,South Dakota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Experiences that are deemed spiritual or sacred often play an important role in both creating and sustaining religious beliefs but the way that these experiences are subsequently interpreted by individuals who have left religious worldviews is underexplored. This paper presents a case study that explores how an individual who previously experienced many vivid and powerful spiritual experiences came to question the ontological nature of those experiences and eventually reject his previous beliefs about them. Doing so involved the transformation of a deeply held meaning system and a radical change in self-identity, from charismatic-evangelical Christian to secular Humanist. A key element of this transformative process was exposure to accounts of similar experiences from other faiths and competing explanatory worldviews, both historical and contemporary. This exposure to other worldviews was an important part of transformation of his worldview. It is suggested that other important factors included his academic training in scientific method and critical thinking, positive personal relationships with people from contrasting cultures, and both a strong commitment to truth and a confidence in his own judgement that were the result of his prior faith and experiences. The confluence of particular intellectual, social and cultural influences led to the transformation of his beliefs and this personal context is critical to understanding the changes he experienced. This case demonstrates the importance of idiosyncratic details in the formation and transformation of worldviews and helps illuminate the complex relationship between globalisation and secularization.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The “Religious” and “Secular” Nature of Self-Spirituality: Insights from the Field,Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR). Paul Heelas (1996) has deemed the emerging religio-cultural form underpinning this moniker, “selfspirituality,” as it sacralizes the self. Upon completing semi-structured interviews with twenty Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR conducted between 2014-2015, I found the discourse of self-spirituality to be informed by four core ethics: the ethic of self-responsibility, the ethic of authenticity, the ethic of productivity and the ethic of self-awareness (Watts 2015). Drawing from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork conducted at three different sites in downtown Toronto—a Toastmaster’s meeting, a Twelve-Step group (Alcoholics Anonymous), and an evangelical church (C3)—I argue that the discourse of self-spirituality can be found, in strikingly similar forms, in each. In other words, despite the ostensible differences between these three organizations they, in fact, endorse quite similar conceptions of the self, as well as, respectively, preach a moral message of self-empowerment, which is tied to an expressive individualism. By presenting data derived from field notes and informal interviews, in tandem with formal documents produced by the organizations themselves, I aim to challenge the commonplace view that so-called religious spaces (i.e. evangelical churches), spiritual spaces (i.e. AA), and secular spaces (i.e. Toastmaster’s) are inherently different, as well as problematize the notion that emic categories such as “religious,” “not religious” and “spiritual but not religious” necessarily reflect vastly different conceptions of the self and the good life.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

Through a close reading of three interviews with young hilonim from across the political spectrum, it highlights one important but hitherto unappreciated aspect of collective generational memory which has primed their understanding of themselves as 'reasonable people.’ Using new fieldwork and survey data, it hypothesizes two things: first, that young hilonim have been susceptible to Likud-led governments’ strategies of legitimizing Occupation through what Van Leeuwen calls discursive 'rationalization;’ second, that hiloni habitus 'priming’ at a formative age has played some as-yet unappreciated role in this. The paper focuses on this 'priming’ process during the 2000s and 2010s.

Religiosity, Spirituality, and Secularity among Nones in the United States and Canada,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Waterloo,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A diversity of (non)religious and spiritual beliefs as well as behaviour exist among those who do not belong to a religious group or tradition. These different approaches and meanings to being a religious none are influenced by a range of variables including one’s pathway into saying they have no religion (e.g. irreligious socialization versus disaffiliation), as well as the social environment that one lives in (e.g. in a high versus low religious setting). Drawing on extensive survey data in the United States and Canada, as well as interview data with thirty religious nones in Calgary, Canada, we offer a sociological exploration into the heterogeneity among religious nones in North America. We focus on a continuum of five types of nones, based on the dimensions of belief and behaviour: involved seculars, inactive non-believers, inactive believers, spiritual but not religious, and church involved believers. In doing so, we examine the diversity of relationships that religious nones’ have or do not have with organized religion, personalized or group spiritualties, non-religion and non-belief, as well as organized secular communities.

Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in the Existence of God(s),Nick Stauner,Case Western Reserve University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although many studies have examined predictors of belief and nonbelief in the existence of god(s), and many theories have surmised implicit reasons for individual differences in theistic beliefs, people’s subjective, explicit reasons for belief or nonbelief have different content. We studied these reasons in large surveys of U.S. adults (undergraduates and Internet-based samples). We examined reasons for nonbelief and belief: intellectual, relational, emotional (positive and negative), intuitive, experiential, socialization-based, and prior experiences with religion. Intellectual reasons predominated among nonbelievers; however, nonbelievers endorsed all reasons somewhat. These results contrasted with reasons for theistic belief, which distributed more equally across categories and averaged high levels of endorsement. Many reasons for nonbelief correlated with more ultimate meaning struggle and search for meaning, but only relational and agnostic reasons correlated with presence of meaning. These results highlight the diversity and importance of self-reported reasons behind people’s beliefs about the existence of God. Additional planned analyses will explore the potential for differences among self-described atheists, agnostics, the spiritual but not religious, and others who report no religious affiliation. No specific differences are anticipated, but any that result will be tested for replicability across multiple samples. This research will seek to explore the implications of nonreligious identities beyond their overt meanings regarding nonbelief in god(s). If reasons for nonbelief differ as well, this would lend further importance to these group identities, whereas null results would call their distinctiveness into question.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Social and psychological aspects of collective spiritual therapies,Danijela Jerotijević,Comenius University,Slovakia,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The focus of this presentation is collective spiritual activities among urban population in Slovakia. They are popular among part of population that might be characterized as „spiritual but not religious“ (Willard, Norenzayan 2017) – people who are not affiliated to traditional (Christian) church, and even have negative opinion about it, but who seek for different kind of spiritual experiences. As Willard and Norenzayan pointed out, „spiritual but not religious“ has „an experiential relationship to the supernatural, and see themselves more connected to the universe as a whole“. Although collective therapies are quite popular at the moment, scholars only partly focus on them. These therapies contain elements of rituals, dance, sharing narratives and personal experiences, and may be charged with different kind of emotions. Here, I will present data from my field (qualitative) research and, combining classical theories of ritual (Durkheim, Malinowski) with psychological theories, I will analyze 1) motives for searching for this kind of experience, 2) try to explain what function they may have and why is group important in this context and, 3) what is the role of emotions in this context. I will also focus on methodological issue and restrictions of qualitaive methods.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Eco-spirituality promotes environmentalism similarly in atheists and religious individuals,Adam Baimel,University of British Columbia,Canada,M,Catherine Li,University of British Columbia,Canada,F,Ara Norenzayan,University of British Columbia,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Atheists may denounce belief in and the importance of god(s) in their lives, but this does not necessarily suggest that they are completely free from other forms of supernatural beliefs that have direct consequences on their attitudes and behaviours. In this study, 786 Americans and 900 Canadian students completed a survey that assessed the extent of their eco-spiritual beliefs. (e.g., belief in 'gaia’ and their tendencies to anthropomorphize the natural world), a diverse set of attitudinal measures regarding climate change related issues, and a set of novel measures assessing sacred value orientations to protecting the environment. We find that although individuals who do not believe in god(s) do score lower on supernatural eco-spiritual beliefs than believers individuals, they do not reject these beliefs to the same extent as they do belief in god(s). And importantly, these types of beliefs have similar downstream consequences in both groups in predicting attitudinal concern for, moralization of, pro-environmental behaviours (including actual green charity donations) and sacred value orientations towards the issue of protecting the natural world. This work provides an important case study in understanding how the psychology and behaviours of self-professed nonbelievers can still be influenced by supernatural beliefs.

Non-Religion, Secularism and the South African Socio-Religious Context: South African Constitutionality in Dialogue with Talal Asad and Charles Taylor,Patrick B. S. Pillay,University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The relative infancy of South Africa as a constitutional state based on the rule of law, has brought issues of secularism and the relationship between religion and State into sharp focus. In a socio-historical context in which religious normativity and the privileging of religion have gone largely uncontested, it is increasingly evident that the previously suppressed voices of the non-religious is enjoying recognition, within a Post-1994 constitutional framework which strikes a delicate balance between the separation of religion from matters of State, on the one hand, and the accommodation of religion in the social life of the country on the other. In dialogue, primarily, with the bodies of works of Tala Asad and Charles Taylor, particularly Formations of the Secular and The Secular Age, respectively, this paper aims to explore the socio-legal and constitutional standing of South Africans who choose not to ascribe to any faith-based religious position. By contrasting the country’s jurisprudence legacy under Apartheid, against the development of specific case law within a new constitutional framework a set of arguments will be advanced to outline the new social contracts in support of the rights and obligations of the non-religious which were previously threatened and/or suppressed. Whilst this changed socio-legal and constitutional environment may make for a more positive outlook for non-religion and unbelief in South Africa it is also evident that, as opposed to the treatment that these crucial subjects have already received in the 'global north’ they remain largely academically unexplored in South Africa and Africa.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Is Confucianism a Cultural Civil Religion?,Rogelio Leal Benavides,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For over two-millennia, the teachings and philosophies of Confucianism have shaped and influenced the moral attitudes and socio-political organisation of the Chinese people and other East Asian societies. Its contemporary revival has risen debates in academic circles on whether it is likely to reposition itself as a code or system of social ethics that could have a major impact in the region and consequently at a global scale. Modernised Confucian values can transform China’s existing state of affairs and become an intellectual and cultural resource to prompt a civil religion in the region with Confucian characteristics. This essay discusses the various dimensions of Confucianism in modern China and East Asia concluding that certain ethical, political, and philosophical components of the tradition—including some of its quasi-religious aspects—could be reconstructed and legitimately implemented as a dominant set of principles that can regulate institutions and mediate people’s behaviours. The constitution of a cultural civil religion is tied to morality, justice, and other precepts committed to social order, political stability, and righteous modes of governance.

The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and the Categories of 'Religion(s)’ and 'Secularity’,Mitsutoshi Horii,Shumei University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The English term 'religion’ first arrived in Japan in the 1850’s, and became established as a social category by the 1880s. At this point, the category of religion denoted specifically Buddhism, sectarian Shinto, and Christianity. The realm of ostensibly 'non-religious’ national ethos of that time can be conceptualised as 'Shinto Secular’ (e.g. Josephson 2012). When Japan surrendered to the Allied powers at the end of the brutal Pacific War, in 1945, the pre-war 'Shinto Secular’ was quickly reconceptualised as 'State Shinto,’ and reclassified as 'religion.’ This signifies the construction of a new type of secularity, which replaced the former 'Shinto’ type. This paper examines the foundation of the post-war Japanese secularity through the critical reading of William Woodard’s The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and Japanese Religions (1972) as well as historical documents from the Occupation. What constitutes post-war Japanese secularity was strongly shaped by the value orientation of American liberal democracy. Importantly, it is the discourse on religion, as binary opposite of liberal democratic 'secularity,’ that naturalises the liberal democratic value orientations as if they represent the order of things and that equate the cultural norms of liberal democracy to natural reason. Thus, the reclassification of post-war 'religion’ played an important role in constructing and authorising the post-war secularity. It is this which constitutes the governing norms of contemporary Japan.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
A Secular Age in Modern India? Jawaharlal Nehru and the Question of Indian Secularity,Sushimita Nath,Jawaharlal Nehru University,India,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Jawaharlal Nehru’s modern and secular vision directly shaped independent India’s polity and society for seventeen years; initially heading the interim legislature (1947-52) and thereafter winning three successive general elections (1952, 1957, 1961). In the Nehruvian period the Indian polity and society saw an emphasis on state-led developmentalism, scientific temper, and a commitment to secularism. In this paper, I shall elaborate upon Nehru’s notion of secularity and his idea of secularism by identifying two dialectical strands of arguments in his reflection on the role of religion in state and society under modern conditions. One argument of secularity, I argue, can be located in his nationalist narrative about its cultural familiarity and suitability for the Indian society; and the other argument relies on the origin and success of secularity in the West and hence its emulation and desirability in modern India. I call the first secularity narrative 'the secular nationalist strand,’ and the second, 'the liberal-Western strand.’ I shall argue that both these strands of arguments were brought together by Nehru to construct a narrative of Indian secularity and to also argue that secularity as such is an universalisable ideal. Following Nehru’s narrative of secularity, I identify three features of Nehruvian secularism and also argue that the withering of Nehruvian type of secularism in contemporary India may be partially attributed to its inability to accommodate democratic politics that, since the 1980s, has been increasingly focussing on religious and other identarian issues, like caste.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Islam as Religion and Secularity: Expressing a modern conceptual distinction from within a discursive tradition,Florian Zemmin,University of Bern,Switzerland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Muslims and non-Muslims alike often take Islam to be a religion that is more than just religion, to contain both the religious and the secular. This understanding, it should be clear, cannot possibly form part of an asserted timeless Islamic essence, since it only became meaningful once the modern conceptual pair of religion and the secular was operative (even though we may in hindsight retrace kernels of that pair to earlier historical moments). This paper attends to the formative period of the modern conceptual order in Arabic to show that Islam indeed came to refer to religion and the secular, but that this double reference of Islam could and can be used to validate the integration as well as the distinction of both spheres. Islamic intellectuals in the modern public sphere answered to the ubiquitous question concerning the relation of these two spheres by appropriating the Islamic discursive tradition to address both religion and the secular. Within this discursive arrangement, they could argue for varying degrees and points of distinction and connection between religion and the secular. I base my argument mainly on an analysis of the journal al-Manar, the widely influential mouthpiece of Islamic modernism that was published in Cairo between 1898 and 1940. I complement this by looking at secular actors who in the context of al-Manar validated Islam as culture and thereby contributed to the double reference of Islam to religion and the secular.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Linguistic structures behind ambiguous non-Buddhist, nonreligious identities,Masoumeh Sara Rahmani,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The contemporary religious landscape is characterized by the rise of networks of individuals who experience the world from a position of “unbelief.” Within this context, meditation movements that promote Buddhist worldviews and practices, repackaged in a scientific and world-affirming language, constitute a fertile subculture within which diverse manifestations of unbelief are constructed and maintained. Self-declared 'nones,’ with little or no interest in Buddhist scripture, ethics, or cosmology, attend meditation courses, sit cross-legged in silence, and devote countless hours to an introspective process traditionally designed to lead the meditator to enlightenment. This presentation scrutinize the underlying linguistic strategies and cultural dispositions that lead to a disconnection between “non-religious” self-identifications and representations of selves that are constructed and interpreted within a particular religious language. It is based on my ethnographic research and in-depth interviews with practitioners of (1) Vipassana meditation in New Zealand and (2) Mindfulness Meditation in the UK.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
What possible meaning can the post-secular have?,Timothy Jones,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The disputed term 'post-secular’ is used as a descriptor for multiple ideas in diverse fields of research. If there is a commonality, it is that the term carries the implicit assertion that there is a particular 'secular' which has been 'transcended', immediately begging the questions of the particularisation of the secular and what form this transcendence is supposed to take. In his 2012 presidential address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, James Beckford critically appraised contemporary uses of the term, concluding that ""the literature on the postsecular is shot through with uncertainty about the question of whether it refers to a concept or a reality."" Beckford sketched six groups of interpretation, which ranged from denial and apathy to zealous claims of the reintroduction of the transcendent into public dialogue. This paper revisits the theme of the post-secular, seeking to interrogate the term in the context of the dialectical relationships of religion / non-religion and secular / eternal.

Contesting the “Islamic” in Islamic Revival: Women Practicing Islamic Visual Arts in Istanbul, Turkey,Hülya Arik,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Questions pertaining to what is “Islamic” and what counts as “traditional” have gained more salience in the post-secular moment, with the unprecedented rise of Islamist movements around the globe. Behind these popular movements are not only political parties and grassroots organizing, but also the reinvigoration of a repertoire of cultural forms, images and historic references that add meaning to what constitutes “Islamic” in socially specific and gendered ways. This paper explores the cultural formations of Islamic revivalism in Turkey with a focus on the Islamic visual arts scene in Istanbul and from the perspective of women artists. Since the 1990s, Islamic visual arts have flourished at an unparalleled scale parallel to the rise of the pro-Islamist politics in Turkey. This creative practice has revived the aesthetic and ethical values, as well as histories, abandoned under the hegemony of Western culture since the early days of the republic, and contributed to the ongoing crisis and fragmentation of the vernacular secularism in Turkey. Importantly, increasing numbers of women artists have participated in this traditionally male-dominated art scene as they came to learn, teach and practice traditional art forms such as miniature, illumination, and calligraphy. In this art scene, artists, instructors, curators, directors, gallery owners and patrons come together to redefine the meaning of “Islamic” and negotiate the cultural boundaries of pursuing Sunni Islam, as well as breaking away from it. This research examines the Islamic and traditional art scene in Turkey as a complex counter-hegemonic space in the context of Islamic revivalism in response the dominant discourses of secularism and Islam in Turkey. It particularly looks at how women artists negotiate and reproduce the notion of “Islamic” and thereby challenge the patriarchal constructions of secularist and religious discourses.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Growing Up Nonreligious: The Intra–Regionality of Children’s Unbeliefs,Rachael Shillitoe,University of York,England,F,Anna Strhan,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper presents preliminary findings from an ethnographic project exploring how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be unbelieving, and how they experience and negotiate their unbeliefs across everyday school and family life. As numbers of the avowedly nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, particularly among younger age cohorts, this research advances our understanding of nonreligion and unbelief through addressing what it means to be unbelieving for children. Drawing on comparative fieldwork across three contrasting geographical 'microclimates’ of religion and nonreligion in the UK (Voas and McAndrew 2012), our project explores the everyday lived realities of children’s unbelief, and how this is experienced, performed and negotiated in relation to the times and spaces of school and home, and across different geographical settings. Our paper will focus particular attention on regional contingencies shaping children’s forms of unbelief, their values, and worldviews across the project’s three field sites located in urban, suburban and rural areas of the south west, north and north-west of England. Reflecting on the relative locations and clustering of religious or nonreligious groups in these contrasting parts of UK while also being attentive to the significance of gender, social class, and ethnicity in these locations, this paper will consider how such intra-regional differences contribute to children’s formation as unbelieving.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
What’s Love Got to Do With It? An Exploratory Study of Religious Nones Experiences With Dating, Relationships and Marriage,Robin Allen,Boise State University,Idaho,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A few years ago the author was completing a qualitative project with in-depth interviews of religious nones. A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives (Hwang, 2013; Morgan, 2013). There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting (Ecklund & Lee, 2011; Manning, 2013). However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships. This availability sample, of 5,080 responses, collects, in addition to demographics, information on how nones find romantic partners, the demographics of whom nones get involved with romantically, and the quality and duration of relationships. The impact on well-being of not being affiliated with a religion on romantic relationships will also be presented, using both quantitative and qualitative data. This study will add to the knowledge base about the nature of day-to-day lives of nones, as well as, contribute a better understanding of the social and psychological well-being of nones.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Insights into the Experiences, Stability and Nature of Unbelief for Older Adults in the UK: Regional Perspectives,Joanna Malone,University of Kent,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the role that regional specificity plays in the experience, understanding and significance of unbelief for older adults living in the UK. Voas and McAndrew’s (2012) research 'Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain’ coins the phrase 'microclimates’ to highlight the disparities found across Britain when looking at Census data on religious affiliation. By taking a regional specific approach the research hopes to uncover whether the non-religiosity of older adults differs depending on the region in which they live and/or grew up as well as taking into account other intersectional influences in their lives. This paper draws on of ongoing doctoral research which will qualitatively explore the nature of unbelief for older adults from a range of different ethnic and social backgrounds, and who do not participate in a nonreligious organisation in the UK. Specifically, the research aims to investigate the life histories of older adults in relation to their unbelief (including their backgrounds, childhood, religious background), the significance and expression of unbelief in older adults’ everyday lives and the implication of their unbelief in relation to specific life events (e.g. education, relationships, family, illness, death, loss).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The maintenance of extinctivism in the face of challenging experiences,Jamin Halberstadt,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although motivational theories in the field emphasize the importance of defending religious beliefs, our previous research suggests that unbelief, for some people, is an equally coherent and functional worldview, which they will be highly motivated to defend. To study such defense, we developed a semi-structured interview to characterize events that challenge nonbelievers’ worldviews. In a pilot study involving over 200 American and New Zealand participants (mostly religious skeptics), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events that it could not. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the nature and frequency of these challenging events, and how they are reconciled with existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we established a framework for classifying participants’ experiences, as well as their strategies for defending their worldviews. Overall 33% (n=238) of extinctivists reported having had experiences that challenged their afterlife beliefs. The most frequently reported type of experience involved encounters with ghosts or spirits. Other categories included: near death experiences, out of body experiences, unexplainable dreams, religious experiences, precognitions, and hallucinations. The majority of participants reconciled these experiences with their extinctivist worldview by attributing them to cognitive failings or flights of imagination.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The Anatomy of Unbelief: Cognitive Science of Religion and Secularization,Mari Ovsepyan,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"'The road atlases of belief versus disbelief and religion versus secularism, provide maps that are much neater and tidier than the spaces in which we find ourselves,' writes James Smith (2014). In this paper I explore the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) approaches to nonreligion and unbelief and challenge their strong focus on 'the absence’ of belief in supernatural agency. I compare the way in which CSR scholars have approached unbelief in the past to the traditional secularization theories and the 'hermeneutical project’ criticised by Mahmood (2006) for its secularised conception of religion understood as 'an abstracted category of beliefs and doctrines.’ Together with Geertz (2010) and Smith (2014) who come against the 'religion for the disembodied minds’, I argue for the importance of developing a biocultural theory of religion, which is based on an expanded view of cognition anchored both in the brain and the body, and extended beyond the borders of individual brains. I develop a cognitive approach to non-religion and unbelief focused on 'the presence' rather than 'the absence’ of belief, drawing the parallels between the concept of 'implicit beliefs’, central to CSR and Talal Asad’s, Saba Machmood’s and Charles Taylor’s notions of 'implicit religion,' 'background sense,' 'deep/ background grammars,' 'commitments,' 'attachments,' and 'schesis’. I argue that such an approach would uniquely accommodate contemporary biological, social and cognitive sciences and provide a way forward for future CSR studies.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Secular versus religious worldviews: Do they fulfil the same psychological functions?,Valerie van Mulukom,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A global increase in individuals who do not hold religious beliefs, and a concurrent increase in secular organisations and even secular rituals (e.g., humanist weddings and funerals), begs for a better understanding of what unbelief entails. Unbelief can be defined as a negative phenomenon, as lacking in religious beliefs, but we argue that non-believers still hold distinct ontological, epistemological and ethical beliefs about reality. We hypothesise that like religious beliefs, such secular beliefs will have profound effects at cognitive, motivational, and emotional levels. Specifically, this project investigates in two studies whether such secular beliefs –organised in worldviews like religious beliefs– have similar psychological functions to religious beliefs, such as providing sources of meaning or coping mechanisms. Study 1 comprises of a systematic review of the current literature on psychological functions of secular beliefs and worldviews. In study 2, the range of psychological functions of secular beliefs will be further investigated through cross-cultural surveys in the UK, Denmark, and Turkey. Study 2 will be an ongoing project until the summer of 2019, but preliminary results will be presented.

Multi-faced Religiosity: Negotiating shinkō (faith) and shūkyō (religion) in the secularised space of social welfare in Japan,Aura Di Febo,University of Manchester,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent scholarship on Japan addressed the historical process through which the category of religion was constructed through a “politically charged boundary-drawing exercise” (Josephson 2012) that codified its position vis-a-vis the 'secular’, resulting in a twofold differentiation running along the private-public divide. The separation between interior beliefs and their external manifestations intertwined with a discrimination of legitimacy between different forms of religiosity, such as commitment to a specific system of doctrine and practice versus non-denominational forms of religiosity partially admitted in the public space (Nishimura 2016). This process, far from resulting in a univocal definition of 'religion’, produced a multi-layered fragmentation which still marks this conceptual field of shinkō/shūkyō. Focusing on welfare activities promoted by the lay-Buddhist organisation Risshō Kōseikai, the paper will discuss how legal constraints and social conventions shape the way practitioners articulate their religiosity when operating in the secularised domain of social care. The need to comply with existing limitations leads to the adoption of strategies of “discursive secularization” (Rots 2017) through which members reformulate their engagement in neutral, less religiously-connoted terms. However, as boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate expressions of religiosity are not clearly drawn, the process is often accompanied by confusion and uneasiness in both practitioners and non-religious actors. The analysis aims to offer new insights not only on the process through which 'religion’ and 'the secular’ came to be constructed in Japan, but also on the ways in which these categories are experienced 'on the ground’ by religious practitioners operating in secularised spaces.

We operationalize the latter as involving attempts to make sense of the world and act sensibly within society without appealing to supernatural agents and authorities. The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts. We hope to show how our model can be utilized to test hypotheses that derive from a host of disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and religious studies.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Understanding Nonbelief in Egypt,Karin van Nieuwkerk,Radbound University,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Nonbelief is a highly sensitive and controversial topic at this particular moment in Egypt. The conceptual binary of religion and non-religion – regardless of the nature and variety of the nonbelievers’ worldview - militant atheism, discrete unbelief and skepticism, humanism, and even secularism - is politicized and mobilized in (social) media outlets. Yet particularly after the 2011 revolution, many - particularly young people - are searching within and beyond the religious tradition in which they were raised for sources of inspiration to fashion their worldview, including more orthodox forms of religion, Sufism, New Age, and varieties of unbelief. Particularly the latter is a great source of 'moral panic’. On the one hand, the assumed growing number of atheists is blamed on, and used to combat, 'extremist’ forms of religion. On the other hand, due to the hardened opposition between religion and non-religion, most nonbelievers who dare to speak out embrace a rather militant anti-religion discourse, leading to fierce debates and clashes in the (social) media. This paper, however, will try to uncover the different forms and experiences of doubt and unbelief. In addition to You Tube channels and other (social) media outlets, the paper is based on ongoing fieldwork and interviews in Egypt. I will use an intersectional approach by comparing the understanding and experiences of men and women, Muslims and Copts with religious doubts and non-belief. Taking a dynamic approach and without assuming (non)religion is a priori a 'thick identity’, I will detail the various trajectories of Egyptian skeptics and non-believers.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The Role of the Press in the Evolution of Secularism in the Arab World: The Case of al-Jinān (1870-1886),Mohammad Magout,University of Leipzig,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism in the Arab World is a topic that has received wide scholarly attention, yet not many works have looked closely at its early evolution and the historical conditions of its emergence in the second half of the 19th C. The main historical narrative in this regard explains the formation of Arab secular thought as a reaction by a number of Christian intellectuals in the Levant against Muslim Ottoman rule. While the earliest expressions of secularism in the Arab world were indeed made by Christians, one cannot simply reduce their views to minoritarian politics. Such a narrative ignores several other important factors, such as the diverse attitudes of Arab Christians toward modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire and internal dynamics within Christian minorities, which witnessed intense debates and competitions, not only along confessional lines, but also socioeconomic and political; for example, between the clergy and the rising bourgeois laity. Within these debates and discussions, the newly emerging Arabic press played a crucial role in the formation, development, and dissemination of secular epistemic, social, and political categories. In this proposed paper, I shall examine this aspect taking al-Jinān journal (1870- 1886) as an example. Published in Beirut by Syrian intellectual and Protestant convert Butrus al-Bustani, al-Jinān was one of the earliest long-running and widely circulated periodicals in the Arab world. It followed a political line that supported Ottoman modernization, but was more explicit in grounding these reforms in notions of human progress and spirit of the age. Its political line will be contrasted with those of two other contemporary Beirut-based journals— al-Bashīr (published by the Jesuits) and Thamarāt al-Funūn (published by Islamic reformists)—in order to provide a picture of the ideological and political climate at the time.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Ex- and non-religious outsiders in the Norwegian 'Bible belt’,David Herbert,Kingston University of London,England,M,Stefan Fisher-Høyrem,University of Agder,Norway,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The medium-sized city Kristiansand, known as capital of Norway’s southern 'Bible belt’, is the municipal centre of a region associated with a high degree of religious profession and practice, where the social order associates high status and political and economic power with evangelical Christianity and conservative family structures. The project Cultural Conflict 2.0 investigates how social media tends to reproduce social order rather than – as it is often assumed – providing platforms for construing one’s own identities and breaking down social barriers. Drawing partly on the figurational sociology of Norbert Elias, this paper presents data from an ongoing investigation of the “established” and “outsiders” in Kristiansand, and the reproduction of these categories in various social media. Among Kristiansand’s 'outsiders’ are young former members of local conservative Christian congregations.

Coming Out as an Atheist: Embedded and Embodied Self Performance on YouTube,Evelina Lundmark,Uppsala University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper I will present the findings of my PhD project. My project aims to expand previous research on atheism by looking specifically at women atheists, who have not been extensively researched. I look at US women performing atheists on YouTube, as well as the technological and relational networks surrounding these videos. Using Actor Network Theory (ANT) I will be looking at these women’s performances as relational and embedded in a particular nexus of technology, associative logic, templates of behavior, as well as material affordances and objects (Latour 2005). I will also be utilizing the idea of counter-public(s) (Downey & Fenton, 2003) in order to tease apart how intersectional concerns affect the particular concerns of different women. The purpose of my study is to look at lived non-religion, not in order to categorize or make sense of the non-religious but to look at the performance of the personal and stigmatized in an ambivalent public. ANT will also be instrumental in dismantling and examining my own preconceptions of the field before and during the collection of empirical work. I will particularly discuss the implications of imagining community or group identity before entering such a disparate field as expressions of non-religiosity on YouTube. I will also examine the use of categories in my work – such as non-religion, and atheism – in order to tease apart what the identification of these women as such hides or magnifies in their narratives.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Secular magic: vanishing others in a secular age,Marek Sullivan,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The theme of this conference—'secularisms’—suggests we know what we are looking for. But if the critical study of secularism or 'the secular’ during the last twenty years has shown one thing, it is secularism’s profound multivalence even (and perhaps especially) in the West. There are multiple ways of approaching secularism and the secular: as a mode of law (Hurd; Sullivan; Pellegrini), a core facet of late-modern subjectivity (Taylor; Asad), a political ideology (Fitzgerald), an obfuscating mythology of the religious other (Cavanaugh). Which should be foregrounded in a search for 'other’ secularisms? What preconceptions condition the line we draw around our anticipated object of study? Can we 'provincialise’ the Western secular simply by locating other secularisms in other cultures? In this paper, I use my current research on the limitations (and failures) of an eminently Western study—Charles Taylor’s A secular age (2007)—as a cautionary tale about examining the secular from within the secular. For although Taylor appears to shine an objective light on what has brought us to our current 'secular age’, he still writes out of a set of coordinates driven by Eurocentric, secular self-understandings that do not recognise the profound role 'other’ religions have already played in the construction of Western secularity (Brown 2007; Mahmood 2010; Casanova 2010). Do we really understand the genealogy of our own 'secular’? Can we start looking for it elsewhere before we do? And what comparative 'magic’ (J. Z. Smith 1982) might be at play in the study of other secularisms?",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Unbelief in 'Glocal’ Perspective,Lois Lee,University of Kent,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper presents initial findings from Understanding Unbelief, Across Disciplines, Across Cultures (ADAC), the central research project of the Understanding Unbelief research programme. ADAC offers a mixed method and cross-cultural perspective on the outlooks and worldviews of atheists and other religious 'unbelievers’, providing a comparative analysis of Brazil, Denmark, Japan, the UK and the US. One aspect of this methodology is indepth interviews with an array of 'unbelievers’ in each of these settings (n 30), and each national sample is split across three distinctive local settings (n10 in each locale). This paper focuses on the UK interviews, examining the ways in which local 'microclimates’ impact upon the outlooks and narratives emerging in these discussions. It also discusses this British experience of intra-national regionality in relation to types and patterns of local variation in Brazil, Denmark, Japan and the US, exploring whether and how regional effects need themselves to be understood in national and global context.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Reaching for a New Sense of Connection? The Diversity of Unbelief in Northern and Central Europe — An Early Analysis,David Herbert,Kingston University of London,England,M,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Surveys shows that unbelievers have a distinctive profile compared to the general population on several indicators related to sociality, collective identity and cultural transmission. For example, they tend to rank family as less important, to identify less with people for whom tradition is important, and to be less willing to fight for their country; but more likely to rate friendship as very important. This evidence suggests a distinctive, less (or differently) embedded, sociality, and lower social conformity, compared to believers. This paper presents early analysis from our Templeton funded Understanding Unbelief project. Reaching for a New Sense of Connection contributes to mapping the diversity of unbelief in Northern and Central Europe by using survey, social media and interview data across six countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Romania). These countries offer diverse (non-) religious backgrounds including post-Communist societies, (eastern Germany, Poland, Romania), environments with strong pressures to religious conformity, (both in the majority culture and minority subcultures); in strong welfare state environments and in less secure contexts; in mixed Christian heritage environments, and with different majority religious heritages (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox). The sample includes environments which have experienced rapid (Netherlands) and gradual (UK) secularization, in cosmopolitan and parochial environments (big cities and small towns), and in environments that have high and low levels of unbelief. In analysing our data, we will bring new theoretical perspectives to the study of unbelief, beginning by using Herbert’s theory of religious publicisation (2011).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Making Secularization Predictive: A Qualitative Comparative Analytic Test,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While there have been many iterations of secularization theory, more recent versions of the theory have addressed prior criticisms and are now in a position to be formalized. In this paper I formalize some of the propositions of secularization theory and use those propositions to generate a number of specific hypotheses that can be derived from the broader theory. I focus specifically on factors that inhibit or facilitate macro-level secularization and then test the hypotheses using data from nearly all sovereign nation-states in the world. Utilizing a configurational comparative method, I find that, certain sets of propositions set forth as conditions of secularization consistently explain the level of secularization in countries around the world. Based on these findings I suggest that there is growing support for modern iterations of secularization theory.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Secular Worldviews among Young People of Muslim Background,Maruta Herding,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,Anja Frank,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Young Muslims, currently much at the centre of discussion in society, academia and the media, are widely perceived as uniformly and collectively religious. Current survey studies suggest that there are also an increasing number of young European Muslims who refer to themselves as nonbelieving. Within an ethnic minority context in Europe, the worldview of young Muslims may be shaped by their upbringing in a Muslim community and in a widely secular environment. Against this backdrop, an ongoing pilot study aims at tracing the development of individual secular worldviews of young adults of Muslim background in Germany. By means of biography analysis, the study tries to grasp the phenomenon of secular worldviews in a Muslim context. This allows for a close analysis of processes and developments and for studying the features of the individual worldviews in depth. This paper will present an exemplary case of first biographical reconstructions. It will look at the actual forms and contents of the particular worldviews that develop from (and in demarcation of) a Muslim background and show, how the secular is defined within this context and in the subjective perspective of the interviewees. Furthermore it will discuss the possibilities and chances of such an approach for researching the phenomenon that we call secular worldviews and ask what consequences this may have for the conception and implications of our notions of secularity and its relation to religion.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Do Religious Actors Use Public Reason? The Case of Assisted Dying in Britain,Steven Kettell,University of Warwick,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The socially constructed nature of the 'religious’ and the 'secular’ spheres remains a contested and frequently politicised issue. A key feature of scholarly debate in this area centres around the discursive terms of entry of religion into the public square, and the extent to which Rawlsian public (or secular) reason acts as a prerequisite for, and hence the only valid form of, democratic deliberation. At the present time, however, the character of these debates remains largely confined to a theoretical level, with little empirical research being conducted on the ways in which religious actors themselves actually engage in public discourse. This paper addresses these issues by analysing religious opposition to recent and on-going campaigns for the legalisation of assisted dying in Britain. Based on an analysis of debates centring on the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments, it shows that religious actors have tended towards the use of secular, as opposed to theological, modes of argumentation. This, the paper suggests, denotes a strategic shift on the part of religious actors, shaped by the increasingly diverse nature of the religion and belief landscape in which they operate.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Trans-Religious Manifestations of the Secular: Revisiting the Concept of Blasphemy in Non-western Contexts,Irmak Yazici,University of Hawaii at Manoa,Hawaii,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper approaches religious controversy as a consequence of flawed and inconclusive processes of secularization in non-western contexts. In order to prove the validity of this approach, a comparative historical analysis of the implementation of secularism in India and Turkey is provided and the Rushdie affair is discussed as the case study that reveals the flawed and inconclusive evolution of secularism in both contexts. Reconceptualization of blasphemy as a socio-political concept rather than a religious one is suggested in consideration of the political reasons behind the affair as opposed to the merely religious/irreligious reasons that had been highlighted by state officials and the media. Implications of the case in both contexts are discussed throughout a critical discursive analysis of the narratives related to the affair. In conclusion, the paper argues that nation-building processes accompanying the implementation of secularism as state ideology in these non-western contexts have indirectly delegitimized religious freedom while serving the legitimation of oppressive majority religions, or particular versions of those, despite aspiring to foster religious freedom in theory.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
“Raising secularism”: Secular educational activism in Turkey,Selin Dingiloğlu,Istanbul University,Turkey,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The educational system has recently become one of the most fervent subjects of the secularism versus-Islamism confrontation in Turkey, especially after the educational reforms initiated by the AKP government in line with the publicly announced target for “raising pious generations”. Several public demonstrations against the government’s educational reforms have been accompanied by the formation of parent organizations, NGOs and voluntary scientist and/or educator initiatives (such as online educational networks) for secular education. Besides, in the last decade, there has been an unparalleled increase in the number of private schools, some of which, using the supply of secular education as a marketing tool, have become a secular alternative for many parents. In this research, after summarizing the relevant qualitative and quantitative surveys to portray the big picture, I share the results of my semi-structured interviews with a group of activists (including parents) about their activities for and definitions of a proper secular education, their approaches towards the religion classes and the alternative offered by the private schools and voluntary networks. I examine whether different ideological, religious or class backgrounds of activists matter, and how? Finally, I raise two questions which also have implications for secularism in Turkey in general: Can we talk about “privatization of secularity”, considering the compensation of the lack of public secular education with private or voluntary institutions? Does the widespread mobilization for secular education represent a grassroot secularist movement in Turkey, which would challenge the widespread characterization of Turkish secularism as a set of officially-dictated, top-down policies lacking popular support and appealing only for cultural or economic elites?",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

Taken together, there are a variety of ways in which secularism is understood and enacted in different Italian territories and in relation to local political subcultures — whether or not Catholicism is locally relevant — and in relation to the religious “others” living in the area. Different secularisms also entail different treatments of nonreligiosity. Nonreligious people, in this respect, face different local opportunity structures in Italy. Despite being a national state, then, nonreligiosity in different local areas has a variety of social meanings, both in connection to the history of religious presence and significance, and in relation to the complexities of local politics. Although it is increasingly neutral, nonreligion still bears strong relations with Italian religion(s), and with the local political cultures."
Social Class and the Stubbornness of Family Myths: How Nonbeliever and Pagan Parents Cope with Intrusions on Parenting by Proselytizing Christian Family Members in the U.S. Bible Belt,Amy I. McClure,Rollins College,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Family scholars have documented how powerful institutions intrude upon marginalized parents. Yet, few have examined the effect that intrusion on parenting takes on a more intimate level. Guided by insights from theories of emotion management and family inequality, I compare how two religiously marginalized groups in the Bible Belt cope with a ubiquitous experience they face as parents—unwelcomed proselytizing by Christian family members. Based on participant-observation and forty in-depth interviews, I document nonbeliever and Pagan parents’ experiences with proselytizing by Christian family members to be common, intrusive, and often perceived as potentially harmful to children. Failing to enforce desired boundaries between children and proselytizers, many parents resort to constructing narratives of equality to describe a condition of inequality. They do so by claiming a “we just don’t talk about religion” arrangement. This narrative, though seemingly equitable, serves as a family myth, obscuring painful truths about power and inequality. Nonbeliever and Pagan parents differ in their reliance on this rhetoric. While nonbeliever parents cling to the family myth as an emotion management device, Pagans more readily acknowledge the “we just don’t talk about religion” strategy as more fiction than fact. I analyze how differences in social class explain nonbelievers’ and Pagans’ differing levels of commitment to this family myth. I place this phenomenon within the culture of Christian hegemony in the Bible Belt, where proselytizing is normative and prevailing norms of privatization within parenting are overridden by a culture of evangelism.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.,.

But it obscured the fact that Japanese people had been vigorously debating the meaning and scope of religious freedom through inherently democratic processes such as free speech, lobbying, and parliamentary procedure for decades before the occupiers even arrived. By simplistically treating religious freedom as a universal principle that states have or lack, the Occupation narrative also masked the occupiers’ own vehement disagreements about the meaning of religious freedom. One takeaway is that any triumphalist story about benevolent Americans bringing freedom to benighted theocrats abroad should make us very nervous.  "
"Politics, Individualism, and Atheism: An Examination of the Political Attitudes of Atheist Activists in a Canadian City",Jonathan S. Simmons,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Given the growth of atheism in the Western world (including activist organizations), and atheists becoming more political, it is essential to understand the identities and values that motivate atheist activism. One avenue for exploring these identities and values is through an examination of individual political attitudes. Although the scholarship on atheist activists’ political attitudes is limited, some scholars have identified the apparent growth of right-wing sentiments within the US atheist movement (LeDrew 2016). Others have identified a contentious relationship between prominent atheists’ political attitudes and egalitarian views (e.g., anti-sexism and anti-racism) (Amarasingam, Amarnath, and Brewster 2016). Of those scholars who have commented on atheists’ viewpoints, most emphasize the liberalism of the broader population of atheists. The purpose of this article is to examine the political attitudes of atheist activists in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and highlight a core set of political attitudes and values that atheists share despite intra-movement disagreements about the relationship between atheist identity and political ideology. My findings show that some Canadian atheist activists’ share a cluster of liberal and Enlightenment ideals that includes personal liberty, individualism, and an absolutist view of free expression.

Cohesiveness of Group Identity and Characterizations of the Out-Group among Atheist and Christian Student Clubs,Joshua Doyle,Duke University,North Carolina,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Do social groups that have a strong ideological basis tend to form a cohesive group identity among group members? This paper investigates how negatively defining an out-group is important, if not integral, for creating a shared identity among members of ideologically based social groups. To explore this connection, I interviewed undergraduate student members of a Christian club and an atheist club at a Midwestern research university. I examined the strength of group identification, how members revealed shared identity, and patterns regarding how participants characterize out-group members. My findings suggest that atheists characterized Christians as less rational and in need of external comfort more than themselves, whereas Christians described atheists as disturbed by suffering and the behavior of some self-identified Christians. Defining one’s in-group and reaffirming the correctness and inherent social benefit of the in-group’s views were essential components of out-group characterizations.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.,.

Despite stereotypes of atheists as atomized, psychologically unhealthy and anti-social (e.g., Bainbridge, 2005), a growing body of evidence suggests that strongly-identified atheists are more likely to join secular social clubs as well as benefit from better mental and physical health compared to less affirmatively-identified secular individuals.

This article examines how the quest for a science of morals informed Secularist expectations and judgements. In this article, I trace how the idea of a rational science of ethics was integrated into the secularist movement. I begin by briefly situating the Secularist movement within the wider moral and epistemological debates of the mid-Victorian period. I address the implications that atheism had on the development of Secularism, and on its contemporary reputation and respectability. I then examine how Holyoake sought to establish the non-theological grounds of morality and the tensions that arose from debates between Secularists regarding the necessity of atheism to Secularism. Finally, I argue that despite significant fissures within the movement created by the question of the necessity of atheism, Secularism nevertheless evinced a high degree of conceptual unity concerning the nature and grounds of morality.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

I will briefly provide some evidence of this difference using extracts which are typical rather than exceptional, and then reflect on why this difference might be of interest not just to oral historians, but to analysts of unbelief in other disciplines."

In contrast, Orthodox Judaism is widely assumed to depend upon belief in God, with unquestioning belief in the divine (as opposed to human) authorship of the Torah (Hebrew bible) constituting the key theological principle differentiating Orthodoxy from its non-Orthodox counterparts. Furthermore, academic research with increasingly visible strictly Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish populations in Europe and North America, has highlighted the centrality of embodied faith (in Hebrew: emune) in God within Haredi lifeworlds. And it was in this context that my exchange with Rachel stood out as extremely surprising: how was it possible that a strictly Orthodox woman, an active adherent to what is widely taken to be an extremely pious, even 'fundamentalist’ form of Judaism, could openly express uncertainty about God’s existence?"

How Do Religious People Become Atheists?

However, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention in the psychology of religion. The current study asks “How do religious people become atheists?” and aims to further the understanding of the process of religious deconversion by offering a proposed model of deconversion. The main findings within the literature are examined, and consideration is given to the concept of deconversion itself and to biases within the psychology of religion. Employing an inductive grounded theory approach based on Strauss and Corbin’s guidelines, we investigated the process of deconversion among a sample of atheist individuals who previously identified as religious. The data consists of 30 testimonies obtained from former clergypersons and six semi-structured interviews with atheist participants recruited through an advocacy group. The resulting model of deconversion is comprised of three core categories: reason and enquiry, criticism and discontent, and personal development. Despite being closely interlinked, these categories were clearly distinct and represent an intellectual impetus, moral and ethical judgments of religion, and overcoming personal issues, respectively. For all participants deconversion developed gradually within the close context of family and local community and the wider cultural context of society at large.

The boundary between religion and nonreligion is blurred in these new practices, but we know very little as yet about what this blurring actually means to the bereaved.

It will argue that scholars of religion and nonreligion have much to offer to the study of death online, and this article acts as an introduction and an invitation to future interdisciplinary exploration.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion,.
Science and Enchantment in Ordinary Non-Religion,Amy Unsworth,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog, Amy Unsworth explores and raises important questions concerning the relationships between “enchanted worldviews” and science in the lives of the nonreligious.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Surveys show that many British people believe in fate, ghosts, an afterlife or other kinds of spiritual or paranormal phenomena. The figures seem a bit surprising for a country that has seen a rise in the numbers of atheists and non-religious people in the past few decades. It’s commonly assumed that Britain has become “disenchanted”, in the sense that people no longer believe, as their forbears once did, in gods, ghosts and spirits that animate the world. Closely related is another assumption: that now we have more-or-less “subtracted” our shared public religious understandings of the world, we will be left with the “genuine deliverance of science, the truth about things, including ourselves, which was waiting all along to be discovered.” My aims are twofold: 1) to better characterise enchantment in our so-called scientific age and 2) to explore whether various enchanted worldviews have any consequences for how people receive and act upon scientific advice."
"Eating Animals, Nonreligion and Reconciling Human-Nonhuman Relations",Anna Sofia Salonen,Tampere University,Finland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog, Anna Sofia Salonen considers the need to incorporate nonreligious people when looking at the relationships between humans and nonhumans.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Eating in general, and eating animals in particular, is a key aspect when considering human relationships with nonhuman others. It is also a question at the heart of the study of religion. How people relate to the question of eating animals is pivotal in many religions and embedded in theological questions concerning human relationships with and responsibilities towards nonhuman creation. But how should we approach the question of eating animals in a world where nonreligion is thriving? Does the rapid rise of nonreligion change how people relate to the nonhuman world, or even who we eat?"
Beneath the Surface: A Critique of the Common Survey Model in the Study of Nonreligion,Elisa Järnefelt,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When measuring nonreligiosity, a common approach is to ask about the participants’ religious or nonreligious affiliation and belief in God. In this critical commentary, this type of methodological approach – referred as the “survey model” – is first placed in its historical context. The article suggests that understanding the historical context and cultural function of the survey model illuminates various theoretical and methodological limitations that have been previously recognized in multiple areas of research from the study of religion and sociology to survey methodology and cognitive sciences. Based on this interdisciplinary review, it is noted that, if relying on the survey model in either qualitative or quantitative research, the studies are likely to sustain the cultural categories of “religion” and “nonreligion” that, paradoxically, are implicitly defined by the survey model, and remain at the level of reputation management. To overcome these limitations and allowing researchers to assess cultural and cognitive aspects of the forming and construing of a human phenomenon like nonreligiosity, the article emphasizes the importance of multimethodology along with an interdisciplinary theoretical framework.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
The Arbiters of Faith: Legislative Assembly of BC Entanglement with Religious Dogma Resulting from Legislative Prayer,Ian Bushfield,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,Teale N. Phelps Bondaroff,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Daily sittings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (BC), Canada begin with a prayer or reflection delivered by a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). MLAs have the option of using a sample prayer from a list of five provided by Legislative staff, or of delivering a prayer of their own devising. The Office of the Clerk is currently revising the list of sample prayers to include a greater diversity of beliefs. To accomplish this task, bureaucrats face a number of practical and constitutional challenges. This article explores these challenges. The Office of the Clerk will have to first identify religious and belief groups that are present in BC, then select a reasonable number of those groups to include on the list, and finally identify prayers and reflections that are representative of those traditions. Each of these steps raises practical questions with respect to how bureaucrats can actually make these decisions, and to more fundamental questions regarding the appropriateness of the decisions made. Given these challenges, this paper concludes that the practice of offering sample prayers should be avoided, and that MLAs should be called upon to deliver prayers and reflections of their own devising, or that legislative prayer be abolished.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
Communicating Religion and Atheism in Central and Eastern Europe,Jenny Vorpahl,University of Potsdam,Germany,F,Dirk Schuster,University of Potsdam,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This book brings together case studies dealing with historical as well as recent phenomena in former socialist nations, which testify the transfer of knowledge about religion and atheism.

With its focus on Central and Eastern Europe this volume is an important contribution to the research on nonreligion and secularity.",2020,Book,"Religion and its others: Studies in Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity",.,.,.
Atheists and Evangelicals in the United States and Canada: No Love Loss,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Waterloo,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog Joel Thiessen and Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme discuss recent findings from their research which explores Nonreligious identity in the US and Canada. In looking at how different (non)religious groups perceive each other, in particular, they discuss how religious nones tend to be more suspicious and critical of religious groups that they believe are “exclusive,” and more open to groups they perceive to be “inclusive”.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"As the proportion of those who say they have no religion grows in both the United States and Canada, one question worth considering is 'how “religious nones” perceive and are perceived by members of other religious traditions’. This question is especially significant as both countries experience increasing (non)religious diversity, particularly in regions once dominated by various Christian traditions that now find their proportionate representation of the population on the decline. Drawing upon a range of survey and interview data, two key findings stand out in our research. First, atheists—as a subset of religious nones—and evangelicals reserve their strongest negative views for one another. This polarization is present in both the United States and Canada, but is especially pronounced in the United States. Second, religious nones generally hold more negative views toward perceived “exclusive” groups, and positive views toward perceived “inclusive” groups."
The Meaning of 'Secular’ as a Scientific Concept,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The meaning of 'secular’ in the scientific use of 'secular trend’, 'secular variation’, and similar terms is a topic that merits historical investigation. The scientific meaning for 'secular’ has an origin and independent role apart from both religion and secularization. Fields in the social sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences have been using the concepts of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ for almost two centuries. The field of economics was the first among the social sciences, while epidemiology was the first in the life sciences. Both disciplines adapted the use of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ from the earth sciences, which borrowed the idea of 'secular’ from astronomy. Early astronomical texts first used 'secular’ to describe 'secular inequalities’ and 'secular variations’ in long-term patterns to celestial motions. Astronomers had found saeculum to be a convenient Latin word from ancient Rome to refer to a century’s duration. This article recounts the intellectual history of the scientific uses, which continue to lack a relationship with anything religious to the present day.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
A History of the Word “Atheism” and the Politics of Dictionaries,Nathan Alexander,University of Erfurt,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Nathan G. Alexander details a history of the ways “atheism” has been defined in English dictionaries, as well as the ways that atheists have pushed back against negative definitions of atheism and influenced these definitions over time.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"How does one define “atheism”? For many, the answer might be to simply look it up in the dictionary. But then, how do dictionary-makers know the definition of a word? And what makes them qualified to define words? In fact, dictionary-makers are not godly beings who descend from the sky to instruct mere mortals like ourselves about the correct meaning of words. Rather, they are human beings with their own biases and commitments that inevitably inform their work. Even if this fact is uncontroversial, the authority of “The Dictionary” still looms over contemporary discussions about the meaning of words. This makes it important to look at the historical process by which these meanings were formed."
The Final Sentence of Section #151 in Adorno’s Minima Moralia,Nick Overduin,Trent University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Adorno’s post-World War II statement that 'No spirit exists’, posited at the conclusion of an essay, provides a crucial window into considerations of modern atheism as well as contemporary anatheism. His utterance occurs historically about half-way between Nietzsche’s infamous declaration of the death of God and these two modern phenomena. His short sentence draws some of its meaning from its immediate context (his essay against occultism), but also from its broader context, the Hegelian notion of the World Spirit. Most significantly, though, it is a highly prescient insight, baldly formulated, and arguably more far-reaching than the madman’s 'God is dead.’ References are made to various thinkers in the past two hundred years to elucidate some of the possible nuances of Adorno’s statement. Both modern atheism and contemporary anatheism can be illuminated as pivoting around Adorno’s shrewd observation.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
Forest Experiences as Nonreligious 'Frame of Reference’,Rebecca Banham,University of Tasmania,Australia,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog, Rebecca Banham explores how experiences in forests can help shape nonreligious understandings of a person’s place in the world.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Landscapes can help people understand and express who they are, and where they fit into the world. My research explored this idea through qualitative interviews with 27 people who were 'interested in forests and forest issues’ in Tasmania, Australia. Forests can be understood as a 'frame of reference’ for nonreligious understandings of what it means to be human. Here I will focus on three (brief) examples of this process: feeling 'small’ and connecting to 'something bigger’; relationships of trust; and experiences of wonder."
The Political Divide Between Lay and Elite Atheism,Richard Cimino,State University of New York-Old Westbury,New York,M,Christopher Smith,Independent scholar,United States,M,Gerrit Cziehso,University of Münster,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A long-standing debate in atheist and secular humanist circles has been whether organized secularists should embrace a broader political agenda or steer clear of such commitments. The latter camp argues that atheism does not include a set of socio-political markers that sets it off from other movements; it is mainly a science- and reason-based philosophy challenging belief in the supernatural that can be adapted to a wide range of political orientations. We find this view increasingly reflected among both atheist and secular humanist leaders and publications, especially in the “new atheist” movement, which has drawn high proportions of atheists interested in science. In this paper, we will examine the political discourse and views of atheist leaders and opinion-makers and those of members of atheist-secular humanist organizations during and after the 2016 elections. We conduct a textual analysis of secularist publications and web sites as well as use a survey we conducted among 3,000 members of a prominent atheist organization to understand the political divide in American secularism and the prospects for greater unity in this diffuse movement.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
Finding the Missing Atheists,Ryan Burge,Eastern Illinois University,Illinois,M,Hannah Smothers,Eastern Illinois University,Illinois,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Anyone who has ever written and distributed a survey knows that the process can oftentimes be drawn out and incredibly tedious. It is almost inevitable that the survey author will realize that they forgot to ask about a specific topic, did not offer enough response options, or did not fully investigate a possible question ordering effect. However, oftentimes these oversights can be seen as opportunities. In the 2010 wave of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, when individuals were asked about their present religion, the response options did not include a choice for atheists, which is present in all other waves of the CCES. If an atheist was taking the questionnaire in 2010 and did not see the optimal choice that described their religious affiliation, what was their backup option? Using both descriptive analysis and machine learning techniques, we try to determine where these misplaced atheists went in the 2010 CCES. In general, we found that the vast majority chose one of the other religiously unaffiliated options: agnostics or nothing in particular, but a significant minority chose another religious tradition. We believe that these results help illuminate how atheists think about their religious affiliation and give researchers more insight into the religious landscape of the United States.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
Is Mindfulness a Religion for Unbelievers?,Sara Rahmani,Victoria University of Wellington,New Zealand,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog, Sara Rahmani shares some qualitative findings from a longitudinal mixed-methods study exploring the diversity of unbelief in the mindfulness subcultures of the UK and the US.",2020,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Mindfulness meditation has entered the mainstream Western culture as a secular and scientific technique that supports physical and mental health. Given this representation, mindfulness meditation is particularly appealing to unbelievers (e.g., atheists, agnostics, and nones) who desire self-transformation yet wish to keep traditional religions at arm’s length. Two years ago, my colleagues and I started a longitudinal, mixed-method project funded by the Understanding Unbelief program to explore the diversity of unbelief in the mindfulness subcultures of the UK and the US and answer a question unsettling to most practitioners and advocates of this practice: “is mindfulness a secular religion for unbelievers?” In this piece, I summarise the qualitative findings of this two-year study and argue that mindfulness meditation commonly functions as a gateway to secular Buddhism and that mindfulness is best seen as a “scientific spirituality.”"
Religious Socialization and Millennial Involvement in Organized and Digital Nonbelief Activities,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Waterloo,Canada,F,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Drawing on a representative survey sample of just over 2,500 young adult respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 from across the USA and Canada, our study seeks to understand who exactly takes part in organized and digital nonbelief activities. Our findings show that (a) there is a positive association between religious childhood socialization and the likelihood of being involved with organized and digital atheist, humanist and secularist activities among young adult nonbelievers; (b) there is a positive link between involvement in organized and digital nonbelief activities and those who experience discrimination due to their nonbelief, mediating the religious childhood socialization association (subcultural identity theory); and (c) there is a remaining positive direct relationship between religious childhood socialization and involvement in organized and digital nonbelief activities as individuals seek to retain some vestiges of religious life among these nonreligious groups (vestiges of religious life theory). We additionally demonstrate that, while fewer than half of nonbelieving Millennials are involved in organized or digital nonbelief settings, those in the USA are more likely to be involved than in Canada. Moreover, in both nations, those who are involved tend to be more engaged in online settings versus in-person contexts.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
"Going Godless: Black Feminism, Humanism, and Anti-Racism",Sikivu Hutchinson,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a 2012 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation Survey, 87% of African American women are religious, making African American women among the most religious demographic groups in the U.S. Although Black women have long been stereotyped as the “backbone” of the Black Church, some Black women non-theists and humanists are bucking these traditions to challenge organized religion. Historically, Black women have relied on churches and faith-based institutions as vehicles for political organizing, cultural identity, and community solidarity. It is for this reason, as well as the slave-era stigma associated with Black female sexuality, that being a Black female humanist and atheist is even more taboo than being a Black male atheist. Dehumanized as either hyper-sexual Jezebels or asexual Aunt Jemimas, Black women have been constructed as less moral, less human, less chaste, and less civilized than respectable white Christian women. “Going Godless” will examine this history vis-à-vis the emergence of Black feminist humanist perspectives in the American secular humanist and atheist movements. For example, how have Black women humanists and atheists drawn on the feminist/womanist legacy of writers and thinkers like Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Nella Larsen? How are they challenging the traditional church/state separation agenda of the mainstream atheist/humanist movements? And what intersectional issues inform a Black feminist humanist political agenda as racial, gender, and socioeconomic inequality intensifies in the U.S.?",2020,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.
Imaginary Friends and Made-Up Stories: How to Explore (Non)Religious Imaginaries Without Asking Belief-Centred Questions,Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
Post-Supernatural Cultures: There and Back Again,Wesley J. Wildman,Boston University,Massachusetts,M,F. LeRon Shults,University of Agder,Norway,M,Saikou Y. Diallo,"Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center",Virginia,M,Ross Gore,"Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center",Virginia,M,Justin Lane,University of Oxford,England,M,"The abandonment of supernatural religious beliefs and rituals seems to occur quite easily in some contexts, but post-supernaturalist cultures require a specific set of conditions that are difficult to produce and sustain on a large scale and thus are historically rare. Despite the worldwide resurgence of supernaturalist religion, some subcultures reliably produce people who deny the existence of supernatural entities. This social phenomenon has evoked competing explanations, many of which enjoy empirical support. We synthesize six of the most influential social-science explanations, demonstrating that they provide complementary perspectives on a complex causal architecture. We incorporate this theoretical synthesis into a computer simulation, identifying conditions under which the predominant attitude toward supernaturalism in a population shifts from acceptance to rejection (and vice versa). The model suggests that the conditions for producing widespread rejection of supernatural worldviews are highly specific and difficult to produce and sustain. When those conditions combine, which is historically rare, a stable social equilibrium emerges within which post-supernaturalist worldviews are widespread; however, this equilibrium is easier to disrupt than equilibria whose cohesion is stabilized by supernatural religion due to persistent cognitive tendencies toward supernaturalism in evolved human minds.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
