Secular Powers and Heretic Undercurrents in a God-Fearing Part of the World,Samuli Schielke,Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When we talk about “secular powers and heretic undercurrents”, “secular powers” provides an understanding of certain things. Secular powers are good to understand some stuff, and not good enough to understand heretic undercurrents, the kind of shadow, or in a more positive sense, the halo that surrounds any tradition that tries to produce an orthodoxy. However, I think “heresy” is maybe a somewhat [too] polemical way to put it. Because what characterises heresy is the idea that it’s judged to be wrong. Heresy has this air of being persecuted, of being controversial. All true of Abu Zayd. But there is a whole field of spiritual experimentation, curiosity, imaginary moves that don’t try to formulate doctrine in the first place. What about them? Maybe heresy is not quite the right term for them as well. This] is what I originally called “heretic undercurrents”, as that what cannot be understood by the religious-secular binary. Although meanwhile I’m not so sure if “heretic” is the right word, because so much of the stuff that Doostdar describes and that people like Bassem Abu Gweily make, is not heretic in the sense that it would be against orthodoxy. It has altogether different concerns.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
What is Nonreligion? On the Virtues of a Meaning Systems Framework for Studying Nonreligious and Religious Worldviews in the Context of Everyday Life,Ann Taves,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Discussions of nonreligion or secularity face a central challenge that has long plagued scholars of religion – that of specifying an object of study. Although several suggestions have been made, I think we can most effectively capture the range of things we want to study by (1) adopting worldviews, defined in terms of “big questions,” as an overarching rubric that encompasses both religious and nonreligious outlooks and (2) nuancing our understanding of worldviews in light of the meaning systems (MS) framework, already in use in psychology. Doing so relieves scholars of the obligation of defining religion and nonreligion and allows us to focus on how individuals and groups characterize themselves. It provides a neutral starting point for analyzing worldviews that is not biased toward religion, and, in so far as a case can be made that all humans must address these questions at least implicitly, it offers a basis for comparison across cultures. The so-called “existentially indifferent” provide a challenge in this regard and allow us to consider the value of an evolutionary perspective on meaning making.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion,.
"“A Swedish Voltaire” The Life and Afterlife of Ingemar Hedenius, 20th-Century Atheist",Anton Jansson,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ingemar Hedenius (1908–1982) was a professor of philosophy, and one of Sweden’s most famous public intellectuals in the decades following the Second World War. This was primarily due to his 1949 work Tro och vetande (English: Belief and Knowledge) in which he criticized religion, and his subsequent activity in the promotion of atheism and criticism of the relationship between church and state. This article engages with Hedenius’s life and works, but has a particular focus on his “afterlife”. The article utilizes theories of cultural memory to examine how Hedenius has been remembered since his death. I argue that Hedenius and his Tro och vetande in Sweden have taken the role of a node, or inescapable orientation point, of discussions of atheism, belief and knowledge, and the validity of Christian truths. Hedenius’s memory continues to loom large over religion and nonreligion in Sweden to this day. The material used as primary sources in this article include scholarly works of philosophy, theology and history, by renowned Swedish academics, but it also contains interpretations of Hedenius in the wider public debate, not least as expressed by the Swedish Humanist Association, who regard him as a main inspiration for their activities.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.
Crossbreeding Atheism with Spirituality: Notes on Soviet and Western Attempts,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,Mikko Sillfors,University of Helsinki,Finland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The recent “nonreligious turn” in studies of secularity has changed the focus from what secularity lacks in comparison to religion to what it offers as an alternative. Various forms of nonreligion have been studied extensively in recent years, yet mostly in the contemporary Western societies. This article shifts the context more to the east and also towards the history by comparing two instances when meaning-making gained a central position within an atheist tradition. For our first example, we examine the appeal to spirituality in the period of late Soviet atheism; the second comes from contemporary Western “atheist spirituality”. By studying the publications by relevant authors, the article explores what can be learned about atheism and spirituality from this comparison, how atheism and spirituality are understood and combined, and the reasons for the sudden emphasis on existential questions within an atheist tradition.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.
Negotiating Religion in Secularised Domains: Religiously Inspired Social Care in Japan,Aura Di Febo,University of Manchester,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Aura Di Febo details how religious actors in Japan employ strategies of 'reflexive secularization’ in order to spread religious values in secularised public spaces.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"These two examples from my fieldwork show how practitioners took advantage of the blurred boundaries between prohibited and accepted forms of religious expression to pursue their missionary goals. Strategies of 'reflexive secularization’ were used to spread religious values in society through their recategorization within secular fields, allowing practitioners to partially convey the teachings and provide spiritual guidance in the form of ethical norms of behaviour. These strategies, however, seemed bound to result in a compromised negotiation: the need to detach these concepts from their religious foundations undermined the value and perceived effectiveness of missionary practice. This was stressed by Nekoda, who pinpointed a difference in “depth” (fukasa) between religion and ethics. The process of negotiation, moreover, was not unidirectional: the need to comply with constraints informing the domain of social welfare and care in Japan led practitioners to adopt a more fluid conception of missionary practice, which prioritised spreading Kōseikai values and “teaching a way of living” over the acquisition of new converts. The case of Kōseikai shows how negotiating “religion” in public spaces in Japan turns into a multidirectional process, not limited to the transmission of religious concepts and practices in nonreligious terms, but also shaping members’ own interpretation and implementation of religious practice."
Sacred Traditions in Secular Britain – What plans for the next coronation reveal about the relationship between religion and tradition,Charlotte Hobson,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog post, Charlotte Hobson explores British sentiments around the sacred using the Monarchy as a case study, asking: who wants a Christian coronation?",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The word sacred is often associated with religion but its use need not be limited in this way. Sacred values come in many forms – two common examples are the notions of equality or justice. They are non-negotiable and fundamental to an individual’s world view and way of life, causing dispute and disruption when threatened or challenged. In this blog I will explore the idea that traditions are held sacred in British society, with reference to attitudes concerning a modern-day coronation ceremony and its contents. On the basis of a small qualitative research project, I propose that the public’s desire to retain explicitly Christian traditions and rituals in the next coronation – despite declining levels of religiosity – is evidence of widespread reverence for sacred tradition rather than, ironically, sacred religion"
The Critical Study of Nonreligion: An Invitation,Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, NSRN Co-Director Chris Cotter places contemporary non-religion studies into conversation with the critical study of religion, assessing two dominant approaches in the field before extolling the virtues of a discursive approach as one way in which rigorous empirical work can be conducted ostensibly under the religion/non-religion binary and contribute to the critical project.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Recent decades have seen an apparent numerical rise in individuals choosing to not identify as religious. The same decades have seen a related rise in studies asking what it might mean to be other than religious, and mapping and theorizing the beliefs, practices, identifications, values and social contexts of 'non-religious’ populations. 'Critical religion’ scholars are broadly dismissive of substantive studies of 'non-religion’, viewing them as perpetuating the problems of the category 'religion’ and uncritically giving substance to a category created for multiple-choice surveys.

Activist Unbelief in Canadian History,Elliot Hanowski,Independent scholar,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Canada has a long history of religious unbelief. This paper offers a social historical survey of its organized, activist forms. The radical thought of the Enlightenment was imported in the late eighteenth century, which saw Voltairean deists like Fleury Mesplet criticizing the Catholic Church in the French-speaking colony of Lower Canada. A long tradition of anticlericalism followed in Quebec even though (or because) the Church was massively influential. The rest of Canada saw freethought and rationalist movements, often organized by working-class autodidacts, developing in the nineteenth century with American and British influences. This tradition continued into the first half of the twentieth century when secularists grappled with fundamentalism and the challenge of radical politics. After World War II the language of secular humanism was deployed and organizations were run by highly educated professionals instead. The position of activist unbelief began to change as Canada shifted from being one of the Western world’s most religious countries to being one of the least in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unbelief became unremarkable, though the persistence of religion meant that the twenty-first century saw a revival of militant atheism. This survey shows that unbelief was never just a pure philosophical position but has always been shaped by the social status quo it evolved in or was opposing. Nor was opposition ever enough; activist unbelievers inevitably had to offer the undecided a vision of the secular world they were working towards, and this meant getting involved in some form of politics.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.
"Stigmatization and Validation of Atheism, Literalism, and Non-Literalism in the Discourse over Evolutionary Theory",Eric O. Silva,Georgia Southern University,Georgia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article explores how atheism, literalism, and non-literalism are validated and stigmatized in public discourse over evolutionary theory. Through an ethnographic content analysis of 1,028 letters to the editor, I examine how authors frame the relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and religious faith. I find there are four ways of doing so: 1) implicit polarization, obliquely denies any compatibility between religion and evolution; 2) distancing, separates one’s position from that of another; 3) articulation, weaves evolution and faith together; and 4) combinations of polarization, distancing, and articulation. Each framing results in some mixture of stigmatization and validation of atheism, literalism, and non-literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes and validates atheism and literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes non-literalism through unacknowledgment. Distancing can validate and stigmatize literalism and non-literalism, while it also results in literalism and atheism being stigmatized by putative allies. Articulation validates non-literalism by representing it in the public sphere and it stigmatizes atheism and literalism through unacknowledgment.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.
Who’s the Master of None?,Erlend Hovdkinn From,University of Oslo,Norway,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The misfits ticking off 'none’ when asked about religious affiliation. An unrecognised chunk of diverging identities: It’s time to ask how the non-religious are recognised in state, law and politics.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"How does the state deal with the considerable portion of the population whose practises, beliefs, identities and belongings are other than religious? How is the phenomenon of non-religion (mis)recognised in different religious, social and cultural contexts on national level across the world today? The emerging research field of non-religion seems to have become an established part of the sociology of religion and other disciplines addressing the varieties of identities associated with what has become to be known as 'the nones’ within religious studies of various kinds. In the Anglophone world 'none’ denotes a survey option declaring 'no affiliation’ with listed worldviews, e.g. Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist etc. For obvious reasons, the category of non-religion covers a vast variety of identities that one way or the other are hallmarked as 'other than religious’ to quote Lois Lee’s minimum common denominator for recognizing the nonreligious."
"Émile Durkheim, the Sacred, and the Nonreligious",Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Galen Watts argues for a Durkheimian approach to nonreligion that focuses less on the labels “religion” and “nonreligion” and more on how the sacred manifests itself in contemporary life.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"From a Durkheimian perspective, secularization theory falls short due to its preoccupation with what is being lost (some substantive conception of “religion”—often informed by Christianity) in lieu of what might be emerging and/or transforming—while discursive approaches (be they critical or otherwise) mistakenly assume that words have a degree of political import and power that they, on their own, rarely do. A Durkheimian perspective would give less attention to the labels “religion”, “nonreligion”, and “secular”, and more attention to what individuals (and the communities they belong to) consider sacred. "
Spirituality: Secular or Religious?,Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Galen Watts questions whether the paradigm of secularization—exemplified by the recent work of Steve Bruce—is ultimately the most useful for studying spirituality. He contends that scholars might be better off eschewing essentialist definitions of “religion” and instead examining the various ways in which individuals operationalize the term “spirituality,” and for what purposes. Drawing from his qualitative research with Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR he argues that individuals who claim “spirituality” do so largely as a result of the religious imaginaries they hold. Thus investigating the nature of these imaginaries might prove far more fruitful than obsessing over whether or notspirituality is “real religion” or not.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"I want to consider the oft-posed question as regards spirituality: is it secular or religious? My thinking about this topic was spurred by reading Steve Bruce’s The Secular Beats the Spiritual, published last year. According to Bruce, the increased interest in “spirituality” as distinct from “religion”—evidenced by a number of polls that show the number of North Americans and Britons who identify as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR) has increased over the last two decades—does not repudiate the secularization thesis, but rather confirms it. Based on my research findings it would seem that individuals who claim “spirituality” (as well as those who reject it) do so largely as a result of the religious imaginary they hold. Like Bruce, my study participants hold their own conceptions of “religion” which inform how they define “spirituality.” Drawing attention to these varying religious imaginaries, I argue, is important, because they illuminate how individuals operationalize the “spiritual but not religious” discourse in distinct ways and for different (sometimes competing) purposes. Bruce’s substantive definition of “religion” is helpful in answering a particular kind of question, but it fails in aiding us to capture the richness of and diversity of the religious (and spiritual) imaginaries alive in Western society today. In turn, we must not stop at the question: Is spirituality secular or religious? but also ask: Who is asking?, Who is answering? and What are the reasons they are giving?"
Social Imaginaries in a Globalizing World,Hans Alma,Utrecht University,Netherlands,M,Guido Vanheeswijck,University of Antwerp,Belgium,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How to study the contemporary dynamics between the religious, the nonreligious and the secular in a globalizing world? Obviously, their relationship is not an empirical datum, liable to the procedures of verification or of logical deduction. We are in need of alternative conceptual and methodological tools. This volume argues that the concept of 'social imaginary’ as it is used by Charles Taylor, is of utmost importance as a methodological tool to understand these dynamics. The first section is dedicated to the conceptual clarification of Taylor’s notion of social imaginaries both through a historical study of their genealogy and through conceptual analysis. In the second section, we clarify the relation of 'social imaginaries’ to the concept of (religious) worldviewing, understood as a process of truth seeking. Furthermore, we discuss the practical usefulness of the concept of social imaginaries for cultural scientists, by focusing on the concept of human rights as a secular social imaginary. In the third and final section, we relate Taylor’s view on the role of social imaginaries and the new paths it opens up for religious studies to other analyses of the secular-religious divide, as they nowadays mainly come to the fore in the debates on what is coined as the 'post-secular.’",2018,Book,"Religion and its others: Studies in Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity",.,.,.
Jack of all Trades?

While this involvement has primarily been with non-religion as the unregulated, tolerated or persecuted wilderness beyond the pristine garden of religious belief, items that can be categorized as “non-religion” have also increasingly become subject to legal regulation in their own right. Despite this long-lasting relationship, research on non-religion and law is virtually non-existent. This is despite the boom in scholarship on both law and religion and non-religion, with new journals, research networks, study programs and research centers being established at a rapid pace. So far, there has been little interest in the history and impact of the many different ways in which law and legal regulations have been involved in the construction, maintenance and negotiation of the boundaries of non-religion."
Subtypes of Religious Nones in the United States and Canada,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Waterloo,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Joel Thiessen and Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme updates us on their 2 year project which aims to answer what the difference is between 'nones’ in the US and Canada.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In the sociology of religion, scholars think of religiosity as a multidimensional spectrum where individuals can be anywhere from actively religious and faithful to non-religious (non-believing, non-belonging and non-practicing). Being a religious none refers to not belonging to any religious group or tradition. In other words, nones share in common their non-belonging. Although nones typically find themselves closer to the non-religious end of the continuum on all its dimensions, recent literature highlights diverse beliefs and practices among nones such that we might think of nones at various distances from that pole. For example, attention has been given to those who “believe without belonging”, are “spiritual but not religious”, or who are actively involved in atheist, humanist, or secular organizations."
Non-Belief: An Islamic Perspective,Kenan Sevinç,Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,Turkey,M,Thomas J. Coleman III,Coventry University,England,M,Ralph W.

Only recently has non-belief in God become a central topic in the field. And while it remains an open question whether or not the research assumptions and theoretical frameworks designed for Western populations of Protestants can be applied to non-believers, exploring non-belief in the Islamic context may pose additional problems. For example, do Western concepts and terms such as “church attendance” or “atheist” have equivalent meaning in the Muslim world? Are there any structural differences within Islam and Christianity that may contribute to the uneven number of self-reported non-believers within these cultures?

Sovereign of Herself: Women’s Narratives of 'Lived Atheism’,Marta Trzebiatowska,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In most western societies the number of female non-believers is growing and atheism has become one manifestation of nonreligion among many (Pew Forum, 2015). However, little is known about female atheists. This article fills the gap by providing the voices of a small percentage of women who consider themselves 'practising’ but not 'active’ atheists. Through a sociological analysis of qualitative interviews with twenty self-identified atheist women I argue for the importance of researching the mundane aspects of female atheism which often fall under the radar when scholars focus predominantly on the vocal and politically active atheists. 'Lived atheism’ comprises small and seemingly insignificant actions and utterances which structure atheist women’s lives and contribute to the creation of new worldviews, symbols, and reflexive strategies. Micro-actions triggered by religious content, symbols and utterances, found in the nominally secular fabric of everyday life, add up to novel forms of gendered agency which is markedly different to outspoken activist atheism, and yet not the same as agnosticism, pure indifference, or 'none-ism’. By examining 'atheist flashpoints’ – moments when dormant atheist convictions come to the surface – I demonstrate how women practice 'everyday atheism’ as they navigate personal and public spaces.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.
Increased Wellbeing from Social Interaction in a Secular Congregation,Michael E. Price,Brunel University London,England,M,Jacques Launay,Brunel University London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Religiosity appears to benefit wellbeing, potentially due to social support offered by religious communities. However, rising secularism implies that fewer people have access to these benefits. To address this problem, we investigated whether these benefits could also be obtained from membership in a secular, quasi-religious community. We conducted a longitudinal study among 92 members of the Sunday Assembly (SA), an international organization of secular congregations. SA members assemble in large services and in smaller interest groups that offer more face-to-face interaction. Once a month for six months, participants completed a questionnaire measuring wellbeing and participation in both SA and non-SA social activities. Panel analysis of longitudinal data revealed that participation in SA small-group activities positively influenced wellbeing over the six-month period, particularly among males. Participation in non-SA social activities, in contrast, had no effect on wellbeing. Aspects of the Sunday service that members perceived as most important, both for creating a sense of community and for friendship formation, were the informal socialising and cooperating that occurs before and after the service itself. Secular congregations may be a viable alternative for non-religious people (and perhaps especially men) who seek the health benefits that religious communities have traditionally offered.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.,.
Are There 'Religion’ and 'the Secular’ in Premodern Japan?,Mitsutoshi Horii,Shumei University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Scholars working on premodern Japan tend to project 'religion’ and 'the secular’ upon the socio-cultural context they study.

This was soon followed by the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which represents the beginning of the modern era in Japan. It was during the early years of the Meiji era (1868-1912) when 'religion’ was gradually understood and translated into Japanese in a definitive way  2003.

An Argument for Unbelief: A Discussion about Terminology,Nickolas Garth Conrad,University of California at Santa Cruz,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The rupture with traditional religion and the loss of belief in God as a widespread religious position represents a sea change in Western thought. However, there were very few self-declared atheists, secularists, and humanists in Western history prior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even during the Modern period, there are not many. This is especially true in my own research of nineteenth and early twentieth-century France. Those who took the name of atheist such as Baron d’Holbach or Jacques-André Naigeon were exceptional militants. The quest to find other such atheists buried in the pages and hidden messages of key books is a limited endeavor. Atheism as a concept does not originate from any single creed or doctrine and is itself open to permutation. Looking for a clear and distinct form of atheism is looking for a conceptual phenomenon constructed by the researcher. The language and words we use control and direct how we understand the past. The term “atheist” imposes a rigidity to a fluid and shifting phenomenon. Instead, we should open up our research to the emergence of modern “unbelief,” as defined by Gordon Stein and Tom Flynn in The Encyclopedia of Unbelief. This paper will argue for “unbelief” as the proper analytical category as a field of future research that will allow for a much larger, more inclusive, variegated set of parameters to understand the rupture with traditional forms of religion or spiritual practices. The important change in intellectual history was not the emergence of a particular atheism that promoted scientism and which held to its positions dogmatically but the acute doubt of past intellectual and religious traditions that led to a spectrum of new ideologies and religious positions.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

This body of work, theoretical and normative in nature, rarely addresses ethnographic data and the lived experiences of situated agents. Starting with a review of three major theoretical approaches to the study of secularism (i.e., the writings of the 19th century Freethinker George Jacob Holyoake, the research of scholars who work in post-Foucauldian traditions, and those beholden to more traditional liberal political assumptions), we ask how each of these theories interfaces with our own ethnographic discoveries. Our interviews with traditionalist Jewish and Muslim women seeking divorces in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, challenge and complexify many of the assumptions that undergird each of the aforementioned theoretical schools.

She argues his functionalist definition of religion, which emphasizes the fundamental importance of sacred forms, helps to illuminate the nature of “religion” in secular modern societies—that being, the cult of the individual. Tracing its genealogy through liberalism and back to the Reformation, and offering contemporary examples to demonstrate its prevalence in modern societies, Batanova makes a powerful case for thinking the sacralization of the “individual” may be the quintessential sacred form in modernity.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In line with Durkheim’s thesis that in traditional society all sacred ideas are represented by religion while in modern society sacred forms transcend religious contexts, I propose to talk about the traditional/modern distinction in the terms religious/post-religious.

In short, sacred forms still exist in our modern secularized world, but in order to spot them, we must refuse always identifying the sacred with religion."

Rather than trying to think them through the somewhat mystifying entity of “the secular”, he suggests that they may be understood in a clearer way as different shapes of the relationship between humans and God. Some of these shapes  correspond with a binary model that juxtapose Islamic and secular-liberal traditions as distinct, mutually external regimes; and some of them do not. Schielke proposes to add to the theme of secularism a more complex landscape of heresies and imaginative explorations that either unsettle a tradition from within, or have different concerns altogether.",2018,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.
Yamagata Bantō: An Atheist in the Tokugawa Period,Shuhei Fujii,University of Tokyo,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the atheistic thought of Yamagata Bantō (1748–1821). The general concept of atheism will also be discussed. The term “atheism” is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Bantō, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603–1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Bantō denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Bantō, gods were a “skillful means” created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Bantō believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Bantō, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Bantō’s “no gods” argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Bantō is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Bantō will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of “atheism” and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

Myth and Solidarity in the Modern World: An Introduction,Timothy Stacey,University of Ottawa,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The world is awash with myths and fake news. The gut consensus among university-educated, post-Enlightenment minds appears to be that we should do away with myths altogether. But what about the positive role that myths play in underwriting shared action? My book, Myth and Solidarity in the Modern World: Beyond Religious and Political Division, sheds light on this positive role and how groups are facilitating the inclusive sharing of myths in diverse spaces. The following is a short introduction to that book. ",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"'Myth’ is a term widely used but rarely defined. It’s employed regularly among journalists and politicians as a euphemism for 'lies,’ such as in the New Yorker’s recent headline, “Mueller’s Indictment Ends Trump Myth of the Russia 'Hoax’.” Just as commonly, myth is used to denote not outright lies, but the basing of broader narratives in prominent, but not statistically significant, events. This usage is employed by social progressives and conservatives alike, such as the myth of the Muslim terrorist or the myth of white privilege. In these cases, the use of myth is associated with the rise of grassroots media. Yet another usage of myth regards religious narratives: in this case, it is the events themselves, rather than their statistical significance that is called into question. Here myth is cast as an age-old problem yet to be removed from the modern psyche. Ill-defined as they are, these usages share a common thread: myths are dangerous, sometimes pernicious things that go against key principles on which modernity is founded."

The fellowship, which has a membership base of over two million, uses a spiritual program that emphasizes belief in a “higher power” and daily spiritual practice to achieve and sustain recovery. In recent years a growing secular movement has been occurring within AA that has prompted an increasing number of secular meeting groups to organize. This trend has seen significant growth since the early 2010s, supported largely through online networking websites such as AA Agnostica, AA Beyond Belief, and Secular AA. The growth and increasing organization of this community has facilitated a culture centered on the experience of being secular in AA and navigating its spiritual program of recovery."
Religious vs cultural? Some findings about the unexpected dichotomy,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When discussing their visits to the churches, a number of my nonreligious informants from Estonia have mentioned that their interest is not 'religious’, but 'cultural’. I have also noticed a similar tendency at conferences – while not directly opposing the two, some colleagues talk of religion and culture as separate entities. Both examples tell us quite a lot about how 'culture’ is perceived – in this context it’s actual meaning seems to be 'secular’ – or, at least, it has strong connotation with 'not religious’. Based on my findings from Estonian media and interviews with nonreligious informants, the paper explores the possibility of studying the essence of nonreligion via the mutual relationships of 'religion’, 'culture’ and 'nonreligion’. Particular attention is paid to the changes in the meanings of 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ words and their connotations.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

A particular cultural element has been recognized in the democratization literature, but the focal point of this study of 'culture' has not been change but persistence. With a methodology that brings together agency, time and social context, this study aims at grasping cultural change in, firstly what has been perceived on the field as a continuity (i.e. settled cultural processes), and secondly what has been consciously recognized as a process of change (i.e. unsettled cultural processes). Focusing on the interrelationship of these cultural processes, I problematize the polarization between secularism(s), Islamism(s) and their 'others’, which has arguably been the deepest ideological struggle behind the core questions of coexistence in the history of Turkey’s democratization. By analyzing a selection of conversational texts from three fields that signify a reproduction of intolerance—these fields are 'Alevis and funerals’, 'women and clothing’, and 'LGBT and show business’—I will argue that Turkey has recently faced some unprecedented questions of tolerance, which includes new approaches to the politics of recognition, difference and negative tolerance. In conclusion, the study will touch upon the ways to examine 'settled’ and 'unsettled’ cultural processes, the re-making of secularism in Turkey, and the differentiated meanings of the concept of tolerance in this period.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Mediating 'Religious’ and 'Non-Religious’ Spaces: A Cultural Expression of a Japanese Religion in Postwar France,Masato Kato,SOAS University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will explore the roles that cultural representations can play in mediating the 'religious’ and 'non-religious’ spaces through the case of a Japanese religion operating in postwar France. Boundaries between religious and non-religious spaces are often contested and negotiated by relevant social actors and institutions, as evinced by recent scholarship on religions in the public sphere. Not much has been discussed so far, however, as to how representations and institutional activities associated with a certain culture can mediate the two spaces by translating the religious representations and messages into the cultural counterparts. To highlight this dynamic, this paper will highlight the case of a Japanese religion known as Tenrikyō as it operates in postwar France. Tenrikyō’s propagation in France is characterised by its two-tier yet legally separate institutional structure involving 'religious’ and 'cultural’ associations—an institutional demarcation necessitated by the French legal framework relating to the 1901 and 1905 laws. In the course of promoting cultural activities as a way to increase the visibility and legitimacy of the name Tenri in the French public, Tenrikyō has at times the reinterpretation process but is not a sufficient explanation for the radical used representations and activities associated with Japan in ways that allow messages and representations that are otherwise confined to religious spaces to go beyond the boundaries thereof. By exploring the case of Tenrikyō in France, this paper will consider the implications and limitations of using cultural resources to present a religious tradition in a non-religious space.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Reinterpreting sacred experiences: Examining how exposure to global and historical diversity can transform an individual's meaning system,James Murphy,South Dakota State University,South Dakota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Experiences that are deemed spiritual or sacred often play an important role in both creating and sustaining religious beliefs but the way that these experiences are subsequently interpreted by individuals who have left religious worldviews is underexplored. This paper presents a case study that explores how an individual who previously experienced many vivid and powerful spiritual experiences came to question the ontological nature of those experiences and eventually reject his previous beliefs about them. Doing so involved the transformation of a deeply held meaning system and a radical change in self-identity, from charismatic-evangelical Christian to secular Humanist. A key element of this transformative process was exposure to accounts of similar experiences from other faiths and competing explanatory worldviews, both historical and contemporary. This exposure to other worldviews was an important part of transformation of his worldview. It is suggested that other important factors included his academic training in scientific method and critical thinking, positive personal relationships with people from contrasting cultures, and both a strong commitment to truth and a confidence in his own judgement that were the result of his prior faith and experiences. The confluence of particular intellectual, social and cultural influences led to the transformation of his beliefs and this personal context is critical to understanding the changes he experienced. This case demonstrates the importance of idiosyncratic details in the formation and transformation of worldviews and helps illuminate the complex relationship between globalisation and secularization.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The “Religious” and “Secular” Nature of Self-Spirituality: Insights from the Field,Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR). Paul Heelas (1996) has deemed the emerging religio-cultural form underpinning this moniker, “selfspirituality,” as it sacralizes the self. Upon completing semi-structured interviews with twenty Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR conducted between 2014-2015, I found the discourse of self-spirituality to be informed by four core ethics: the ethic of self-responsibility, the ethic of authenticity, the ethic of productivity and the ethic of self-awareness (Watts 2015). Drawing from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork conducted at three different sites in downtown Toronto—a Toastmaster’s meeting, a Twelve-Step group (Alcoholics Anonymous), and an evangelical church (C3)—I argue that the discourse of self-spirituality can be found, in strikingly similar forms, in each. In other words, despite the ostensible differences between these three organizations they, in fact, endorse quite similar conceptions of the self, as well as, respectively, preach a moral message of self-empowerment, which is tied to an expressive individualism. By presenting data derived from field notes and informal interviews, in tandem with formal documents produced by the organizations themselves, I aim to challenge the commonplace view that so-called religious spaces (i.e. evangelical churches), spiritual spaces (i.e. AA), and secular spaces (i.e. Toastmaster’s) are inherently different, as well as problematize the notion that emic categories such as “religious,” “not religious” and “spiritual but not religious” necessarily reflect vastly different conceptions of the self and the good life.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

Through a close reading of three interviews with young hilonim from across the political spectrum, it highlights one important but hitherto unappreciated aspect of collective generational memory which has primed their understanding of themselves as 'reasonable people.’ Using new fieldwork and survey data, it hypothesizes two things: first, that young hilonim have been susceptible to Likud-led governments’ strategies of legitimizing Occupation through what Van Leeuwen calls discursive 'rationalization;’ second, that hiloni habitus 'priming’ at a formative age has played some as-yet unappreciated role in this. The paper focuses on this 'priming’ process during the 2000s and 2010s.

Drawing on extensive survey data in the United States and Canada, as well as interview data with thirty religious nones in Calgary, Canada, we offer a sociological exploration into the heterogeneity among religious nones in North America. We focus on a continuum of five types of nones, based on the dimensions of belief and behaviour: involved seculars, inactive non-believers, inactive believers, spiritual but not religious, and church involved believers. In doing so, we examine the diversity of relationships that religious nones’ have or do not have with organized religion, personalized or group spiritualties, non-religion and non-belief, as well as organized secular communities. We give attention to how and why these respective groups have grown or declined over time, as well as where and why they are strongly or weakly represented (nationally and regionally).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in the Existence of God(s),Nick Stauner,Case Western Reserve University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although many studies have examined predictors of belief and nonbelief in the existence of god(s), and many theories have surmised implicit reasons for individual differences in theistic beliefs, people’s subjective, explicit reasons for belief or nonbelief have different content. We studied these reasons in large surveys of U.S. adults (undergraduates and Internet-based samples). We examined reasons for nonbelief and belief: intellectual, relational, emotional (positive and negative), intuitive, experiential, socialization-based, and prior experiences with religion. Intellectual reasons predominated among nonbelievers; however, nonbelievers endorsed all reasons somewhat. These results contrasted with reasons for theistic belief, which distributed more equally across categories and averaged high levels of endorsement. Many reasons for nonbelief correlated with more ultimate meaning struggle and search for meaning, but only relational and agnostic reasons correlated with presence of meaning. These results highlight the diversity and importance of self-reported reasons behind people’s beliefs about the existence of God. Additional planned analyses will explore the potential for differences among self-described atheists, agnostics, the spiritual but not religious, and others who report no religious affiliation. No specific differences are anticipated, but any that result will be tested for replicability across multiple samples. This research will seek to explore the implications of nonreligious identities beyond their overt meanings regarding nonbelief in god(s). If reasons for nonbelief differ as well, this would lend further importance to these group identities, whereas null results would call their distinctiveness into question.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

They are popular among part of population that might be characterized as „spiritual but not religious“ (Willard, Norenzayan 2017) – people who are not affiliated to traditional (Christian) church, and even have negative opinion about it, but who seek for different kind of spiritual experiences. As Willard and Norenzayan pointed out, „spiritual but not religious“ has „an experiential relationship to the supernatural, and see themselves more connected to the universe as a whole“. Although collective therapies are quite popular at the moment, scholars only partly focus on them. These therapies contain elements of rituals, dance, sharing narratives and personal experiences, and may be charged with different kind of emotions. Here, I will present data from my field (qualitative) research and, combining classical theories of ritual (Durkheim, Malinowski) with psychological theories, I will analyze 1) motives for searching for this kind of experience, 2) try to explain what function they may have and why is group important in this context and, 3) what is the role of emotions in this context.

(e.g., belief in 'gaia’ and their tendencies to anthropomorphize the natural world), a diverse set of attitudinal measures regarding climate change related issues, and a set of novel measures assessing sacred value orientations to protecting the environment. We find that although individuals who do not believe in god(s) do score lower on supernatural eco-spiritual beliefs than believers individuals, they do not reject these beliefs to the same extent as they do belief in god(s). And importantly, these types of beliefs have similar downstream consequences in both groups in predicting attitudinal concern for, moralization of, pro-environmental behaviours (including actual green charity donations) and sacred value orientations towards the issue of protecting the natural world. This work provides an important case study in understanding how the psychology and behaviours of self-professed nonbelievers can still be influenced by supernatural beliefs.

Pillay,University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The relative infancy of South Africa as a constitutional state based on the rule of law, has brought issues of secularism and the relationship between religion and State into sharp focus. In a socio-historical context in which religious normativity and the privileging of religion have gone largely uncontested, it is increasingly evident that the previously suppressed voices of the non-religious is enjoying recognition, within a Post-1994 constitutional framework which strikes a delicate balance between the separation of religion from matters of State, on the one hand, and the accommodation of religion in the social life of the country on the other. In dialogue, primarily, with the bodies of works of Tala Asad and Charles Taylor, particularly Formations of the Secular and The Secular Age, respectively, this paper aims to explore the socio-legal and constitutional standing of South Africans who choose not to ascribe to any faith-based religious position. By contrasting the country’s jurisprudence legacy under Apartheid, against the development of specific case law within a new constitutional framework a set of arguments will be advanced to outline the new social contracts in support of the rights and obligations of the non-religious which were previously threatened and/or suppressed. Whilst this changed socio-legal and constitutional environment may make for a more positive outlook for non-religion and unbelief in South Africa it is also evident that, as opposed to the treatment that these crucial subjects have already received in the 'global north’ they remain largely academically unexplored in South Africa and Africa.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Is Confucianism a Cultural Civil Religion?,Rogelio Leal Benavides,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For over two-millennia, the teachings and philosophies of Confucianism have shaped and influenced the moral attitudes and socio-political organisation of the Chinese people and other East Asian societies. Its contemporary revival has risen debates in academic circles on whether it is likely to reposition itself as a code or system of social ethics that could have a major impact in the region and consequently at a global scale. Modernised Confucian values can transform China’s existing state of affairs and become an intellectual and cultural resource to prompt a civil religion in the region with Confucian characteristics. This essay discusses the various dimensions of Confucianism in modern China and East Asia concluding that certain ethical, political, and philosophical components of the tradition—including some of its quasi-religious aspects—could be reconstructed and legitimately implemented as a dominant set of principles that can regulate institutions and mediate people’s behaviours. The constitution of a cultural civil religion is tied to morality, justice, and other precepts committed to social order, political stability, and righteous modes of governance.

The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and the Categories of 'Religion(s)’ and 'Secularity’,Mitsutoshi Horii,Shumei University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The English term 'religion’ first arrived in Japan in the 1850’s, and became established as a social category by the 1880s. At this point, the category of religion denoted specifically Buddhism, sectarian Shinto, and Christianity. The realm of ostensibly 'non-religious’ national ethos of that time can be conceptualised as 'Shinto Secular’ (e.g. Josephson 2012). When Japan surrendered to the Allied powers at the end of the brutal Pacific War, in 1945, the pre-war 'Shinto Secular’ was quickly reconceptualised as 'State Shinto,’ and reclassified as 'religion.’ This signifies the construction of a new type of secularity, which replaced the former 'Shinto’ type. This paper examines the foundation of the post-war Japanese secularity through the critical reading of William Woodard’s The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and Japanese Religions (1972) as well as historical documents from the Occupation. What constitutes post-war Japanese secularity was strongly shaped by the value orientation of American liberal democracy. Importantly, it is the discourse on religion, as binary opposite of liberal democratic 'secularity,’ that naturalises the liberal democratic value orientations as if they represent the order of things and that equate the cultural norms of liberal democracy to natural reason. Thus, the reclassification of post-war 'religion’ played an important role in constructing and authorising the post-war secularity. It is this which constitutes the governing norms of contemporary Japan.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
A Secular Age in Modern India? Jawaharlal Nehru and the Question of Indian Secularity,Sushimita Nath,Jawaharlal Nehru University,India,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Jawaharlal Nehru’s modern and secular vision directly shaped independent India’s polity and society for seventeen years; initially heading the interim legislature (1947-52) and thereafter winning three successive general elections (1952, 1957, 1961). In the Nehruvian period the Indian polity and society saw an emphasis on state-led developmentalism, scientific temper, and a commitment to secularism. In this paper, I shall elaborate upon Nehru’s notion of secularity and his idea of secularism by identifying two dialectical strands of arguments in his reflection on the role of religion in state and society under modern conditions. One argument of secularity, I argue, can be located in his nationalist narrative about its cultural familiarity and suitability for the Indian society; and the other argument relies on the origin and success of secularity in the West and hence its emulation and desirability in modern India. I call the first secularity narrative 'the secular nationalist strand,’ and the second, 'the liberal-Western strand.’ I shall argue that both these strands of arguments were brought together by Nehru to construct a narrative of Indian secularity and to also argue that secularity as such is an universalisable ideal. Following Nehru’s narrative of secularity, I identify three features of Nehruvian secularism and also argue that the withering of Nehruvian type of secularism in contemporary India may be partially attributed to its inability to accommodate democratic politics that, since the 1980s, has been increasingly focussing on religious and other identarian issues, like caste.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Islam as Religion and Secularity: Expressing a modern conceptual distinction from within a discursive tradition,Florian Zemmin,University of Bern,Switzerland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Muslims and non-Muslims alike often take Islam to be a religion that is more than just religion, to contain both the religious and the secular. This understanding, it should be clear, cannot possibly form part of an asserted timeless Islamic essence, since it only became meaningful once the modern conceptual pair of religion and the secular was operative (even though we may in hindsight retrace kernels of that pair to earlier historical moments). This paper attends to the formative period of the modern conceptual order in Arabic to show that Islam indeed came to refer to religion and the secular, but that this double reference of Islam could and can be used to validate the integration as well as the distinction of both spheres. Islamic intellectuals in the modern public sphere answered to the ubiquitous question concerning the relation of these two spheres by appropriating the Islamic discursive tradition to address both religion and the secular. Within this discursive arrangement, they could argue for varying degrees and points of distinction and connection between religion and the secular. I base my argument mainly on an analysis of the journal al-Manar, the widely influential mouthpiece of Islamic modernism that was published in Cairo between 1898 and 1940. I complement this by looking at secular actors who in the context of al-Manar validated Islam as culture and thereby contributed to the double reference of Islam to religion and the secular.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

What possible meaning can the post-secular have?,Timothy Jones,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The disputed term 'post-secular’ is used as a descriptor for multiple ideas in diverse fields of research. If there is a commonality, it is that the term carries the implicit assertion that there is a particular 'secular' which has been 'transcended', immediately begging the questions of the particularisation of the secular and what form this transcendence is supposed to take. In his 2012 presidential address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, James Beckford critically appraised contemporary uses of the term, concluding that ""the literature on the postsecular is shot through with uncertainty about the question of whether it refers to a concept or a reality."" Beckford sketched six groups of interpretation, which ranged from denial and apathy to zealous claims of the reintroduction of the transcendent into public dialogue.

"Contesting the 'Islamic' in Islamic Revival: Women Practicing Islamic Visual Arts in Istanbul, Turkey",Hülya Arik,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Questions pertaining to what is “Islamic” and what counts as “traditional” have gained more salience in the post-secular moment, with the unprecedented rise of Islamist movements around the globe. Behind these popular movements are not only political parties and grassroots organizing, but also the reinvigoration of a repertoire of cultural forms, images and historic references that add meaning to what constitutes “Islamic” in socially specific and gendered ways. This paper explores the cultural formations of Islamic revivalism in Turkey with a focus on the Islamic visual arts scene in Istanbul and from the perspective of women artists. Since the 1990s, Islamic visual arts have flourished at an unparalleled scale parallel to the rise of the pro-Islamist politics in Turkey. This creative practice has revived the aesthetic and ethical values, as well as histories, abandoned under the hegemony of Western culture since the early days of the republic, and contributed to the ongoing crisis and fragmentation of the vernacular secularism in Turkey. Importantly, increasing numbers of women artists have participated in this traditionally male-dominated art scene as they came to learn, teach and practice traditional art forms such as miniature, illumination, and calligraphy. In this art scene, artists, instructors, curators, directors, gallery owners and patrons come together to redefine the meaning of “Islamic” and negotiate the cultural boundaries of pursuing Sunni Islam, as well as breaking away from it.

It particularly looks at how women artists negotiate and reproduce the notion of “Islamic” and thereby challenge the patriarchal constructions of secularist and religious discourses.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Growing Up Nonreligious: The Intra–Regionality of Children’s Unbeliefs,Rachael Shillitoe,University of York,England,F,Anna Strhan,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper presents preliminary findings from an ethnographic project exploring how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be unbelieving, and how they experience and negotiate their unbeliefs across everyday school and family life. As numbers of the avowedly nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, particularly among younger age cohorts, this research advances our understanding of nonreligion and unbelief through addressing what it means to be unbelieving for children. Drawing on comparative fieldwork across three contrasting geographical 'microclimates’ of religion and nonreligion in the UK (Voas and McAndrew 2012), our project explores the everyday lived realities of children’s unbelief, and how this is experienced, performed and negotiated in relation to the times and spaces of school and home, and across different geographical settings. Our paper will focus particular attention on regional contingencies shaping children’s forms of unbelief, their values, and worldviews across the project’s three field sites located in urban, suburban and rural areas of the south west, north and north-west of England. Reflecting on the relative locations and clustering of religious or nonreligious groups in these contrasting parts of UK while also being attentive to the significance of gender, social class, and ethnicity in these locations, this paper will consider how such intra-regional differences contribute to children’s formation as unbelieving.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
"What’s Love Got to Do With It? An Exploratory Study of Religious Nones Experiences With Dating, Relationships and Marriage",Robin Allen,Boise State University,Idaho,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A few years ago the author was completing a qualitative project with in-depth interviews of religious nones. A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives (Hwang, 2013; Morgan, 2013). There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting (Ecklund & Lee, 2011; Manning, 2013). However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships. This availability sample, of 5,080 responses, collects, in addition to demographics, information on how nones find romantic partners, the demographics of whom nones get involved with romantically, and the quality and duration of relationships. The impact on well-being of not being affiliated with a religion on romantic relationships will also be presented, using both quantitative and qualitative data. This study will add to the knowledge base about the nature of day-to-day lives of nones, as well as, contribute a better understanding of the social and psychological well-being of nones.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
"Insights into the Experiences, Stability and Nature of Unbelief for Older Adults in the UK: Regional Perspectives",Joanna Malone,University of Kent,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the role that regional specificity plays in the experience, understanding and significance of unbelief for older adults living in the UK. Voas and McAndrew’s (2012) research 'Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain’ coins the phrase 'microclimates’ to highlight the disparities found across Britain when looking at Census data on religious affiliation. By taking a regional specific approach the research hopes to uncover whether the non-religiosity of older adults differs depending on the region in which they live and/or grew up as well as taking into account other intersectional influences in their lives. This paper draws on of ongoing doctoral research which will qualitatively explore the nature of unbelief for older adults from a range of different ethnic and social backgrounds, and who do not participate in a nonreligious organisation in the UK. Specifically, the research aims to investigate the life histories of older adults in relation to their unbelief (including their backgrounds, childhood, religious background), the significance and expression of unbelief in older adults’ everyday lives and the implication of their unbelief in relation to specific life events (e.g. education, relationships, family, illness, death, loss).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The maintenance of extinctivism in the face of challenging experiences,Jamin Halberstadt,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although motivational theories in the field emphasize the importance of defending religious beliefs, our previous research suggests that unbelief, for some people, is an equally coherent and functional worldview, which they will be highly motivated to defend. To study such defense, we developed a semi-structured interview to characterize events that challenge nonbelievers’ worldviews. In a pilot study involving over 200 American and New Zealand participants (mostly religious skeptics), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events that it could not. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the nature and frequency of these challenging events, and how they are reconciled with existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we established a framework for classifying participants’ experiences, as well as their strategies for defending their worldviews. Overall 33% (n=238) of extinctivists reported having had experiences that challenged their afterlife beliefs. The most frequently reported type of experience involved encounters with ghosts or spirits. Other categories included: near death experiences, out of body experiences, unexplainable dreams, religious experiences, precognitions, and hallucinations. The majority of participants reconciled these experiences with their extinctivist worldview by attributing them to cognitive failings or flights of imagination.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The Anatomy of Unbelief: Cognitive Science of Religion and Secularization,Mari Ovsepyan,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"'The road atlases of belief versus disbelief and religion versus secularism, provide maps that are much neater and tidier than the spaces in which we find ourselves,' writes James Smith (2014). In this paper I explore the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) approaches to nonreligion and unbelief and challenge their strong focus on 'the absence’ of belief in supernatural agency. I compare the way in which CSR scholars have approached unbelief in the past to the traditional secularization theories and the 'hermeneutical project’ criticised by Mahmood (2006) for its secularised conception of religion understood as 'an abstracted category of beliefs and doctrines.’ Together with Geertz (2010) and Smith (2014) who come against the 'religion for the disembodied minds’, I argue for the importance of developing a biocultural theory of religion, which is based on an expanded view of cognition anchored both in the brain and the body, and extended beyond the borders of individual brains. I develop a cognitive approach to non-religion and unbelief focused on 'the presence' rather than 'the absence’ of belief, drawing the parallels between the concept of 'implicit beliefs’, central to CSR and Talal Asad’s, Saba Machmood’s and Charles Taylor’s notions of 'implicit religion,' 'background sense,' 'deep/ background grammars,' 'commitments,' 'attachments,' and 'schesis’. I argue that such an approach would uniquely accommodate contemporary biological, social and cognitive sciences and provide a way forward for future CSR studies.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Secular versus religious worldviews: Do they fulfil the same psychological functions?,Valerie van Mulukom,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A global increase in individuals who do not hold religious beliefs, and a concurrent increase in secular organisations and even secular rituals (e.g., humanist weddings and funerals), begs for a better understanding of what unbelief entails. Unbelief can be defined as a negative phenomenon, as lacking in religious beliefs, but we argue that non-believers still hold distinct ontological, epistemological and ethical beliefs about reality. We hypothesise that like religious beliefs, such secular beliefs will have profound effects at cognitive, motivational, and emotional levels. Specifically, this project investigates in two studies whether such secular beliefs –organised in worldviews like religious beliefs– have similar psychological functions to religious beliefs, such as providing sources of meaning or coping mechanisms. Study 1 comprises of a systematic review of the current literature on psychological functions of secular beliefs and worldviews. In study 2, the range of psychological functions of secular beliefs will be further investigated through cross-cultural surveys in the UK, Denmark, and Turkey. Study 2 will be an ongoing project until the summer of 2019, but preliminary results will be presented. Together, these studies will inform us how worldviews –whether secular or religious– support us psychologically.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Multi-faced Religiosity: Negotiating shinkō (faith) and shūkyō (religion) in the secularised space of social welfare in Japan,Aura Di Febo,University of Manchester,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent scholarship on Japan addressed the historical process through which the category of religion was constructed through a “politically charged boundary-drawing exercise” (Josephson 2012) that codified its position vis-a-vis the 'secular’, resulting in a twofold differentiation running along the private-public divide. The separation between interior beliefs and their external manifestations intertwined with a discrimination of legitimacy between different forms of religiosity, such as commitment to a specific system of doctrine and practice versus non-denominational forms of religiosity partially admitted in the public space (Nishimura 2016). This process, far from resulting in a univocal definition of 'religion’, produced a multi-layered fragmentation which still marks this conceptual field of shinkō/shūkyō. Focusing on welfare activities promoted by the lay-Buddhist organisation Risshō Kōseikai, the paper will discuss how legal constraints and social conventions shape the way practitioners articulate their religiosity when operating in the secularised domain of social care. The need to comply with existing limitations leads to the adoption of strategies of “discursive secularization” (Rots 2017) through which members reformulate their engagement in neutral, less religiously-connoted terms. However, as boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate expressions of religiosity are not clearly drawn, the process is often accompanied by confusion and uneasiness in both practitioners and non-religious actors. The analysis aims to offer new insights not only on the process through which 'religion’ and 'the secular’ came to be constructed in Japan, but also on the ways in which these categories are experienced 'on the ground’ by religious practitioners operating in secularised spaces.

Analyzing Analytic Worldviews: Particularizing Nonreligion through Computational Modeling and Simulation,F.

We operationalize the latter as involving attempts to make sense of the world and act sensibly within society without appealing to supernatural agents and authorities. The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts. We hope to show how our model can be utilized to test hypotheses that derive from a host of disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and religious studies.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Understanding Nonbelief in Egypt,Karin van Nieuwkerk,Radbound University,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Nonbelief is a highly sensitive and controversial topic at this particular moment in Egypt. The conceptual binary of religion and non-religion – regardless of the nature and variety of the nonbelievers’ worldview - militant atheism, discrete unbelief and skepticism, humanism, and even secularism - is politicized and mobilized in (social) media outlets. Yet particularly after the 2011 revolution, many - particularly young people - are searching within and beyond the religious tradition in which they were raised for sources of inspiration to fashion their worldview, including more orthodox forms of religion, Sufism, New Age, and varieties of unbelief. Particularly the latter is a great source of 'moral panic’. On the one hand, the assumed growing number of atheists is blamed on, and used to combat, 'extremist’ forms of religion. On the other hand, due to the hardened opposition between religion and non-religion, most nonbelievers who dare to speak out embrace a rather militant anti-religion discourse, leading to fierce debates and clashes in the (social) media. This paper, however, will try to uncover the different forms and experiences of doubt and unbelief. In addition to You Tube channels and other (social) media outlets, the paper is based on ongoing fieldwork and interviews in Egypt. I will use an intersectional approach by comparing the understanding and experiences of men and women, Muslims and Copts with religious doubts and non-belief. Taking a dynamic approach and without assuming (non)religion is a priori a 'thick identity’, I will detail the various trajectories of Egyptian skeptics and non-believers.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
The Role of the Press in the Evolution of Secularism in the Arab World: The Case of al-Jinān (1870-1886),Mohammad Magout,University of Leipzig,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism in the Arab World is a topic that has received wide scholarly attention, yet not many works have looked closely at its early evolution and the historical conditions of its emergence in the second half of the 19th C. The main historical narrative in this regard explains the formation of Arab secular thought as a reaction by a number of Christian intellectuals in the Levant against Muslim Ottoman rule. While the earliest expressions of secularism in the Arab world were indeed made by Christians, one cannot simply reduce their views to minoritarian politics. Such a narrative ignores several other important factors, such as the diverse attitudes of Arab Christians toward modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire and internal dynamics within Christian minorities, which witnessed intense debates and competitions, not only along confessional lines, but also socioeconomic and political; for example, between the clergy and the rising bourgeois laity. Within these debates and discussions, the newly emerging Arabic press played a crucial role in the formation, development, and dissemination of secular epistemic, social, and political categories. In this proposed paper, I shall examine this aspect taking al-Jinān journal (1870- 1886) as an example. Published in Beirut by Syrian intellectual and Protestant convert Butrus al-Bustani, al-Jinān was one of the earliest long-running and widely circulated periodicals in the Arab world. It followed a political line that supported Ottoman modernization, but was more explicit in grounding these reforms in notions of human progress and spirit of the age. Its political line will be contrasted with those of two other contemporary Beirut-based journals— al-Bashīr (published by the Jesuits) and Thamarāt al-Funūn (published by Islamic reformists)—in order to provide a picture of the ideological and political climate at the time.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

The project Cultural Conflict 2.0 investigates how social media tends to reproduce social order rather than – as it is often assumed – providing platforms for construing one’s own identities and breaking down social barriers. Drawing partly on the figurational sociology of Norbert Elias, this paper presents data from an ongoing investigation of the “established” and “outsiders” in Kristiansand, and the reproduction of these categories in various social media. Among Kristiansand’s 'outsiders’ are young former members of local conservative Christian congregations. The mediated (and not) performances of this loosely defined group provides a case study in how non-religious identities and networked communities are construed not (only) based on explicit rejection of religion, but also in negotiation with a particular social order that happens to carry locally specific 'religious’ overtones.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

My project aims to expand previous research on atheism by looking specifically at women atheists, who have not been extensively researched. I look at US women performing atheists on YouTube, as well as the technological and relational networks surrounding these videos. Using Actor Network Theory (ANT) I will be looking at these women’s performances as relational and embedded in a particular nexus of technology, associative logic, templates of behavior, as well as material affordances and objects (Latour 2005). I will also be utilizing the idea of counter-public(s) (Downey & Fenton, 2003) in order to tease apart how intersectional concerns affect the particular concerns of different women. The purpose of my study is to look at lived non-religion, not in order to categorize or make sense of the non-religious but to look at the performance of the personal and stigmatized in an ambivalent public. ANT will also be instrumental in dismantling and examining my own preconceptions of the field before and during the collection of empirical work. I will particularly discuss the implications of imagining community or group identity before entering such a disparate field as expressions of non-religiosity on YouTube.

Secular magic: vanishing others in a secular age,Marek Sullivan,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The theme of this conference—'secularisms’—suggests we know what we are looking for. But if the critical study of secularism or 'the secular’ during the last twenty years has shown one thing, it is secularism’s profound multivalence even (and perhaps especially) in the West. There are multiple ways of approaching secularism and the secular: as a mode of law (Hurd; Sullivan; Pellegrini), a core facet of late-modern subjectivity (Taylor; Asad), a political ideology (Fitzgerald), an obfuscating mythology of the religious other (Cavanaugh). Which should be foregrounded in a search for 'other’ secularisms? What preconceptions condition the line we draw around our anticipated object of study? Can we 'provincialise’ the Western secular simply by locating other secularisms in other cultures? In this paper, I use my current research on the limitations (and failures) of an eminently Western study—Charles Taylor’s A secular age (2007)—as a cautionary tale about examining the secular from within the secular. For although Taylor appears to shine an objective light on what has brought us to our current 'secular age’, he still writes out of a set of coordinates driven by Eurocentric, secular self-understandings that do not recognise the profound role 'other’ religions have already played in the construction of Western secularity (Brown 2007; Mahmood 2010; Casanova 2010). Do we really understand the genealogy of our own 'secular’? Can we start looking for it elsewhere before we do? And what comparative 'magic’ (J. Z. Smith 1982) might be at play in the study of other secularisms?",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

Reaching for a New Sense of Connection? The Diversity of Unbelief in Northern and Central Europe — An Early Analysis,David Herbert,Kingston University of London,England,M,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Surveys shows that unbelievers have a distinctive profile compared to the general population on several indicators related to sociality, collective identity and cultural transmission. For example, they tend to rank family as less important, to identify less with people for whom tradition is important, and to be less willing to fight for their country; but more likely to rate friendship as very important. This evidence suggests a distinctive, less (or differently) embedded, sociality, and lower social conformity, compared to believers. This paper presents early analysis from our Templeton funded Understanding Unbelief project. Reaching for a New Sense of Connection contributes to mapping the diversity of unbelief in Northern and Central Europe by using survey, social media and interview data across six countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Romania). These countries offer diverse (non-) religious backgrounds including post-Communist societies, (eastern Germany, Poland, Romania), environments with strong pressures to religious conformity, (both in the majority culture and minority subcultures); in strong welfare state environments and in less secure contexts; in mixed Christian heritage environments, and with different majority religious heritages (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox). The sample includes environments which have experienced rapid (Netherlands) and gradual (UK) secularization, in cosmopolitan and parochial environments (big cities and small towns), and in environments that have high and low levels of unbelief. In analysing our data, we will bring new theoretical perspectives to the study of unbelief, beginning by using Herbert’s theory of religious publicisation (2011).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

In this paper I formalize some of the propositions of secularization theory and use those propositions to generate a number of specific hypotheses that can be derived from the broader theory. I focus specifically on factors that inhibit or facilitate macro-level secularization and then test the hypotheses using data from nearly all sovereign nation-states in the world. Utilizing a configurational comparative method, I find that, certain sets of propositions set forth as conditions of secularization consistently explain the level of secularization in countries around the world.

Secular Worldviews among Young People of Muslim Background,Maruta Herding,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,Anja Frank,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Young Muslims, currently much at the centre of discussion in society, academia and the media, are widely perceived as uniformly and collectively religious. Current survey studies suggest that there are also an increasing number of young European Muslims who refer to themselves as nonbelieving. Within an ethnic minority context in Europe, the worldview of young Muslims may be shaped by their upbringing in a Muslim community and in a widely secular environment. Against this backdrop, an ongoing pilot study aims at tracing the development of individual secular worldviews of young adults of Muslim background in Germany. By means of biography analysis, the study tries to grasp the phenomenon of secular worldviews in a Muslim context. This allows for a close analysis of processes and developments and for studying the features of the individual worldviews in depth. This paper will present an exemplary case of first biographical reconstructions. It will look at the actual forms and contents of the particular worldviews that develop from (and in demarcation of) a Muslim background and show, how the secular is defined within this context and in the subjective perspective of the interviewees. Furthermore it will discuss the possibilities and chances of such an approach for researching the phenomenon that we call secular worldviews and ask what consequences this may have for the conception and implications of our notions of secularity and its relation to religion.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Do Religious Actors Use Public Reason? The Case of Assisted Dying in Britain,Steven Kettell,University of Warwick,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The socially constructed nature of the 'religious’ and the 'secular’ spheres remains a contested and frequently politicised issue. A key feature of scholarly debate in this area centres around the discursive terms of entry of religion into the public square, and the extent to which Rawlsian public (or secular) reason acts as a prerequisite for, and hence the only valid form of, democratic deliberation. At the present time, however, the character of these debates remains largely confined to a theoretical level, with little empirical research being conducted on the ways in which religious actors themselves actually engage in public discourse. This paper addresses these issues by analysing religious opposition to recent and on-going campaigns for the legalisation of assisted dying in Britain. Based on an analysis of debates centring on the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments, it shows that religious actors have tended towards the use of secular, as opposed to theological, modes of argumentation. This, the paper suggests, denotes a strategic shift on the part of religious actors, shaped by the increasingly diverse nature of the religion and belief landscape in which they operate.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
Trans-Religious Manifestations of the Secular: Revisiting the Concept of Blasphemy in Non-western Contexts,Irmak Yazici,University of Hawaii at Manoa,Hawaii,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper approaches religious controversy as a consequence of flawed and inconclusive processes of secularization in non-western contexts. In order to prove the validity of this approach, a comparative historical analysis of the implementation of secularism in India and Turkey is provided and the Rushdie affair is discussed as the case study that reveals the flawed and inconclusive evolution of secularism in both contexts. Reconceptualization of blasphemy as a socio-political concept rather than a religious one is suggested in consideration of the political reasons behind the affair as opposed to the merely religious/irreligious reasons that had been highlighted by state officials and the media. Implications of the case in both contexts are discussed throughout a critical discursive analysis of the narratives related to the affair. In conclusion, the paper argues that nation-building processes accompanying the implementation of secularism as state ideology in these non-western contexts have indirectly delegitimized religious freedom while serving the legitimation of oppressive majority religions, or particular versions of those, despite aspiring to foster religious freedom in theory.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.
“Raising secularism”: Secular educational activism in Turkey,Selin Dingiloğlu,Istanbul University,Turkey,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The educational system has recently become one of the most fervent subjects of the secularism versus-Islamism confrontation in Turkey, especially after the educational reforms initiated by the AKP government in line with the publicly announced target for “raising pious generations”. Several public demonstrations against the government’s educational reforms have been accompanied by the formation of parent organizations, NGOs and voluntary scientist and/or educator initiatives (such as online educational networks) for secular education. Besides, in the last decade, there has been an unparalleled increase in the number of private schools, some of which, using the supply of secular education as a marketing tool, have become a secular alternative for many parents. In this research, after summarizing the relevant qualitative and quantitative surveys to portray the big picture, I share the results of my semi-structured interviews with a group of activists (including parents) about their activities for and definitions of a proper secular education, their approaches towards the religion classes and the alternative offered by the private schools and voluntary networks. I examine whether different ideological, religious or class backgrounds of activists matter, and how? Finally, I raise two questions which also have implications for secularism in Turkey in general: Can we talk about “privatization of secularity”, considering the compensation of the lack of public secular education with private or voluntary institutions? Does the widespread mobilization for secular education represent a grassroot secularist movement in Turkey, which would challenge the widespread characterization of Turkish secularism as a set of officially-dictated, top-down policies lacking popular support and appealing only for cultural or economic elites?",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.

Due to cultural norms, people may be motivated to respond in a socially desirable way. In addition, deliberating about beliefs may yield different responses than intuition-based responses. To develop a better understanding of the relationship between intuition and self-reported belief, we developed a new implicit measure of supernatural belief. Specifically, we adapted the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to measure supernatural belief. In a preregistered online study of 404 American participants, we found that the strength of associations between supernatural entities (e.g., god, devil, heaven) and the concept “real” (as opposed to the concept “imaginary”) predicted self-reported supernatural belief and self-reported religious behavior, and these associations were of comparable magnitude to those found in studies where supernatural belief was measured implicitly using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These results provide provisional evidence that the AMP can be used as an implicit measure of supernatural belief.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Co-producing secularity in Sweden - The Muslim mainstream,Ann af Burén,Uppsala University/Södertörn University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper focus lies on a group that is little understood in relation to unbelief, namely people inthe by estimation large group of Muslims in Sweden who are not particularly religious by conventional ways of measuring religiosity (here labelled Mainstream Muslims). The growing body of knowledge about Swedish secular culture is biased towards the majority segment of the population that has a Lutheran cultural background. This means that we lack knowledge about the presumed mainstream of culturally Muslim people. We lack knowledge about how people in this group talk about, think, live and relate to their religious heritage, and the nature of their unbelief. My contribution to the understanding of unbelief is empirical in the sense that I am bringing in qualitative material that focuses mainstream Muslims, as well as theoretical in the sense that I argue for the importance of a sensory approach, drawing on analytical insights from the field of lived religion.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
After lives: What and who is left behind?,Katie Aston,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This project explores how narratives about death, pain, or the end of life, are articulated and how this may give shape to an existential culture unique to unbelievers. This research will explore a spectrum of beliefs among unbelievers; from the explicit rejection of religion to more agnostic standpoints. The purpose is to address what beliefs, languages and ideas are embraced or negotiated in the absence of religious traditions. In particular, I am interested in the following questions: How do unbelievers discuss the end of life, pain or suffering? What language and symbols are used? What can life stories tell us about agnosticism and unbelief? How do unbelief narratives deal with the idea of “afterlife” and pain? Do accounts of positive and negative forms of unbelief indicate different kinds of attitude toward death, suffering and the afterlife? Life stories will add nuance and context to death, pain and the end of life. Such stories will illuminate the numerous shifts and changes within the life cycle of an individual. Life stories also give participants agency to express which parts of their lives have relevance to the formations of their beliefs and particular worldview, allowing the interviewee to determine which of their experiences is relevant to their understanding of death. Finally, narratives require language and in telling their stories participants will illuminate the limits of available language in articulating death, pain and the end of life and the limits imposed on the unbeliever by agnosticism or simply “not knowing” what is to be expected after death.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Exploring unbelief in the religious education classroom,Stephen Pett,RE Today Services,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The inclusion of non-religious worldviews has been part of the discourse of religious education (RE) in the UK for some years now. In practice, there is little coherence about how non-religious beliefs or worldviews are handled in the RE classroom: many teachers struggle with this. Humanism is offered by many agreed syllabuses as an example of a non-religious worldview and resources from Humanists UK are increasingly used in classrooms. However, emerging academic research points to different kinds of non-religious worldviews, including but not limited to humanist orientations (e.g., Recognising the Non-religious: Reimagining the Secular, Lee 2015). Research also reveals complexities to non-religious worldviews, such as findings which show that people who do not believe in God and/or identify as non-religious sometimes hold beliefs that do not obviously fit within a materialist worldview: beliefs in supernatural beings, in the soul, in life after death, angels and reincarnation (e.g., Post-religious Britain: The Faith of the Faithless, Spencer/Weldin, Theos 2012; The “No Religion” Population of Britain, Bullivant 2017). It is in this context the Understanding Unbelief programme offers a significant contribution to RE. RE Today has a long history of supporting teachers in the RE classroom, from teachers of 4 year olds to teachers of A level students. Its contribution to the Understanding Unbelief programme is to engage with teachers of 11-14 year olds in the first instance. A future project may look to extend the work to teachers of primary-age pupils. RE Today will develop materials that bring the research findings of the Understanding Unbelief programme to teachers and pupils in the RE classroom. These resources will help pupils to address questions about the nature and diversity of the wide range of beliefs and commitments of so-called unbelievers, including a deeper understanding of atheism and a wider understanding of less discussed outlooks such as agnosticism. The resources will enable pupils to explore what people believe in, not just what they don’t believe in. They will get beyond the stereotypes of New Atheists offered in the media (and some RE lessons), and demonstrate the diversity of experiences and outlooks within the broader ‘unbelieving’ population.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Magical thinking in contexts and situations of unbelief,Theodoros Kyriakides,The Open University/University of Cyprus,England/Cyprus,M,Richard Irvine,The Open University/University of St Andrews,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Our project will research the importance of magical thinking in the everyday lives of people who identify as non-believers. Our aim is to understand cognitive and subjective tensions surrounding unbelief as an explicit religious attitude, and its relationship to magical thinking as an element of the inter-subjective dynamic of social life. Here, we wish to examine whether magical thinking and unbelief are necessarily contradictory phenomena, exploring whether instances of their co-existence are best explained as evidence of compartmentalisation, or if magical practices might play a generative role as a constituent element of unbelief. Through ethnographic research methods of interviewing, life histories, focus groups and participant-observation, we will investigate whether magical thinking constitutes a core element of human sociality and subjectivity in the everyday context of the mundane and the habitual, even within contexts generally understood as non-religious. Bridging existing research on non-religion with anthropological research on magic, we will explore magical thinking as a reactive dimension of contemporary, secularised societies, focussing on everyday practices through which self-defined unbelievers adopt a stance which can be understood as enchanted, and adopt perspectives of causality which can be understood as magical. More specifically, we will pay emphasis on how people attribute agency and luck to everyday objects, and how magic as a way of thinking and acting in the world manifests in human consciousness under conditions of doubt and uncertainty. We believe this will allow us to reach a more grounded understanding in the importance of magical belief in the everyday lives of unbelievers. Our project will compare two field sites: the UK and Cyprus.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.

Taken together, there are a variety of ways in which secularism is understood and enacted in different Italian territories and in relation to local political subcultures — whether or not Catholicism is locally relevant — and in relation to the religious “others” living in the area. Different secularisms also entail different treatments of nonreligiosity. Nonreligious people, in this respect, face different local opportunity structures in Italy. Despite being a national state, then, nonreligiosity in different local areas has a variety of social meanings, both in connection to the history of religious presence and significance, and in relation to the complexities of local politics. Although it is increasingly neutral, nonreligion still bears strong relations with Italian religion(s), and with the local political cultures."
Social Class and the Stubbornness of Family Myths: How Nonbeliever and Pagan Parents Cope with Intrusions on Parenting by Proselytizing Christian Family Members in the U.S. Bible Belt,Amy I. McClure,Rollins College,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Family scholars have documented how powerful institutions intrude upon marginalized parents. Yet, few have examined the effect that intrusion on parenting takes on a more intimate level. Guided by insights from theories of emotion management and family inequality, I compare how two religiously marginalized groups in the Bible Belt cope with a ubiquitous experience they face as parents—unwelcomed proselytizing by Christian family members. Based on participant-observation and forty in-depth interviews, I document nonbeliever and Pagan parents’ experiences with proselytizing by Christian family members to be common, intrusive, and often perceived as potentially harmful to children. Failing to enforce desired boundaries between children and proselytizers, many parents resort to constructing narratives of equality to describe a condition of inequality. They do so by claiming a “we just don’t talk about religion” arrangement. This narrative, though seemingly equitable, serves as a family myth, obscuring painful truths about power and inequality. Nonbeliever and Pagan parents differ in their reliance on this rhetoric. While nonbeliever parents cling to the family myth as an emotion management device, Pagans more readily acknowledge the “we just don’t talk about religion” strategy as more fiction than fact. I analyze how differences in social class explain nonbelievers’ and Pagans’ differing levels of commitment to this family myth. I place this phenomenon within the culture of Christian hegemony in the Bible Belt, where proselytizing is normative and prevailing norms of privatization within parenting are overridden by a culture of evangelism.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.,.

But it obscured the fact that Japanese people had been vigorously debating the meaning and scope of religious freedom through inherently democratic processes such as free speech, lobbying, and parliamentary procedure for decades before the occupiers even arrived. By simplistically treating religious freedom as a universal principle that states have or lack, the Occupation narrative also masked the occupiers’ own vehement disagreements about the meaning of religious freedom. One takeaway is that any triumphalist story about benevolent Americans bringing freedom to benighted theocrats abroad should make us very nervous.  "

Simmons,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Given the growth of atheism in the Western world (including activist organizations), and atheists becoming more political, it is essential to understand the identities and values that motivate atheist activism. One avenue for exploring these identities and values is through an examination of individual political attitudes. Although the scholarship on atheist activists’ political attitudes is limited, some scholars have identified the apparent growth of right-wing sentiments within the US atheist movement (LeDrew 2016). Others have identified a contentious relationship between prominent atheists’ political attitudes and egalitarian views (e.g., anti-sexism and anti-racism) (Amarasingam, Amarnath, and Brewster 2016). Of those scholars who have commented on atheists’ viewpoints, most emphasize the liberalism of the broader population of atheists. The purpose of this article is to examine the political attitudes of atheist activists in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and highlight a core set of political attitudes and values that atheists share despite intra-movement disagreements about the relationship between atheist identity and political ideology. My findings show that some Canadian atheist activists’ share a cluster of liberal and Enlightenment ideals that includes personal liberty, individualism, and an absolutist view of free expression.

This paper investigates how negatively defining an out-group is important, if not integral, for creating a shared identity among members of ideologically based social groups. To explore this connection, I interviewed undergraduate student members of a Christian club and an atheist club at a Midwestern research university. I examined the strength of group identification, how members revealed shared identity, and patterns regarding how participants characterize out-group members. My findings suggest that atheists characterized Christians as less rational and in need of external comfort more than themselves, whereas Christians described atheists as disturbed by suffering and the behavior of some self-identified Christians. Defining one’s in-group and reaffirming the correctness and inherent social benefit of the in-group’s views were essential components of out-group characterizations.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.,.

This is an especially important gap in the religion/secularism research because religiosity appears to be declining throughout the Western world (Zuckerman, Galen & Pasquale, 2016). Despite stereotypes of atheists as atomized, psychologically unhealthy and anti-social (e.g., Bainbridge, 2005), a growing body of evidence suggests that strongly-identified atheists are more likely to join secular social clubs as well as benefit from better mental and physical health compared to less affirmatively-identified secular individuals. As a step toward developing this line of research, the present article operationalizes social network structure within the study of secularism, discusses the available research with a focus on atheism in particular, and integrates this research into a schematic theoretical model of atheist self-identity, network structure and health.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.,.

Little attention, however, has been paid to what nonreligious people thought about the issue of race and racism. This is something I tackle in my recent book, Race in a Godless World: Atheism, Race, and Civilization, 1850-1914.

The Secularist movement, initiated by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851, was a primarily artisan working-class social movement that sought to ground social ethics upon a rational, scientific, and non-theological foundation. This article examines how the quest for a science of morals informed Secularist expectations and judgements. In this article, I trace how the idea of a rational science of ethics was integrated into the secularist movement. I begin by briefly situating the Secularist movement within the wider moral and epistemological debates of the mid-Victorian period. I address the implications that atheism had on the development of Secularism, and on its contemporary reputation and respectability. I then examine how Holyoake sought to establish the non-theological grounds of morality and the tensions that arose from debates between Secularists regarding the necessity of atheism to Secularism. Finally, I argue that despite significant fissures within the movement created by the question of the necessity of atheism, Secularism nevertheless evinced a high degree of conceptual unity concerning the nature and grounds of morality.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.

I will briefly provide some evidence of this difference using extracts which are typical rather than exceptional, and then reflect on why this difference might be of interest not just to oral historians, but to analysts of unbelief in other disciplines."

In contrast, Orthodox Judaism is widely assumed to depend upon belief in God, with unquestioning belief in the divine (as opposed to human) authorship of the Torah (Hebrew bible) constituting the key theological principle differentiating Orthodoxy from its non-Orthodox counterparts. Furthermore, academic research with increasingly visible strictly Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish populations in Europe and North America, has highlighted the centrality of embodied faith (in Hebrew: emune) in God within Haredi lifeworlds. And it was in this context that my exchange with Rachel stood out as extremely surprising: how was it possible that a strictly Orthodox woman, an active adherent to what is widely taken to be an extremely pious, even 'fundamentalist’ form of Judaism, could openly express uncertainty about God’s existence?"

The current study asks “How do religious people become atheists?” and aims to further the understanding of the process of religious deconversion by offering a proposed model of deconversion. The main findings within the literature are examined, and consideration is given to the concept of deconversion itself and to biases within the psychology of religion. Employing an inductive grounded theory approach based on Strauss and Corbin’s guidelines, we investigated the process of deconversion among a sample of atheist individuals who previously identified as religious. The data consists of 30 testimonies obtained from former clergypersons and six semi-structured interviews with atheist participants recruited through an advocacy group. The resulting model of deconversion is comprised of three core categories: reason and enquiry, criticism and discontent, and personal development. Despite being closely interlinked, these categories were clearly distinct and represent an intellectual impetus, moral and ethical judgments of religion, and overcoming personal issues, respectively.

Focusing on the differences that occur between quantitative and qualitative approaches to nonbelief – both in terms of defining the research subject-matter and methodologically – it aims to showcase how even slight dissimilarities in definitions and methods can yield widely different results.

We conducted 70 interviews across 25 European cities/towns and triangulated our findings with survey and social media network data. Our presentation highlights three key findings. First, the persistence of beliefs and practices connected to luck, fate and human and cosmic interconnection, which do not fit within a strictly rationalist-materialist framework. This was found across our sample, including in longstanding low religious cultures (like Eastern Germany), though more prominently in high religion environments. Second, we found a range of forms of collective organisation, from state-funded humanist organisations in Norway to Polish movements focused on challenging aspects of the populist religious conservative government’s public policy.

Studies 2–5 are in progress. In Study 2, participants chose often atheist, nonreligious, agnostic or irreligious as their identification. Less than 10% identified as secular, religious, spiritual but not religious, or spiritual seeker. These eight groups had different attitudes toward religion in terms of evaluation and attitude importance, ambivalence and interest. Study 3 shows that having a simple view of knowledge and trusting personal justification in religion predicts seeing science and religion as conflicting whereas endorsing cognitive biases and viewing religion to be important for society predicts the non-conflict view.

In this presentation, I will share results from Pew Research Center analysis of 34 countries with sizeable populations of people who are actively religious (who claim a religious identity and attend services at least monthly), inactively religious (who claim a religious identity and who attend services infrequently) and who claim no religious identity (“nones”). In 27 of the 34 countries studied, the actively religious are a minority of the adult population: Especially in Europe, but also in some countries of Asia and the Pacific, levels of affiliation are declining and regular attendance at religious services is relatively rare. In many economically advanced countries, the share of “nones” has been rapidly increasing, while the share of inactively religious people has declined. How will societies change in the future if the inactively religious share of the population continues to shrink and the percentage that is religiously unaffiliated grows?

However, I have discovered that it is adequate – if not to say necessary – to explore other fields as well to fully understand contemporary non-religious identities in Oslo. One possible way of approaching this, which I have followed in my research, is the importance of culture in the post-industrial city and how it affects meaning-making in everyday life. In this, ‘culture’ is understood both as it is involved in ethnic compositions of different ‘cultural’ traditions (this is ‘culture’ as in ‘multiculture’), including the religious components, but also how culture plays a role in urban area discourses, which is related to consumerism and a, relatively speaking, new fashion of engaging with urban life, which perhaps is better understood as cultures of postmodernity. The former tells us a lot about how nones perceive their own (non-)religiosity and their perceptions of the religious other, while the latter can teach us a lot about how nones make sense of their everyday life and beyond. This is my methodological proposition: that there is much to learn from exploring discursive fields in which various approaches to ‘culture’ as a concept plays an important part when aiming to understand ‘non-religion’ in all its varieties. In particular, to understand the purportedly ‘indifferent’ stand to faith and worldviews in Scandinavia (e.g. addressed by Zuckerman 2008) we need to investigate how culture itself is changing alongside more ‘obvious’ transformations in the religious landscape. In this paper I will show how this conceptualisation of culture is instrumental for my analysis of the social formation of non-religious identities in Oslo by portraying a sample of different profiles, in which gender, class and ethnicity is decisive.

A cross-national exploration of the roots of unbelievers’ views on morality,Tomas Ståhl,University of Illinois at Chicago,Illinois,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"There is a widespread cross-cultural stereotype suggesting that atheists are untrustworthy and lack a moral compass. Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2-3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief -- analytic cognitive style.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Unbelief throughout history: Studying atheism in ancient Greece,Ramón Soneira Martínez,University of Erfurt,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It is undeniable that the study of unbelief is receiving much attention in the last decades. The diverse works about the non-religious positions have shown the complexity of the phenomenon of unbelief. The principal aim of this communication is to conceptualize unbelief as a historical notion, principally in Ancient Greece, emphasizing the importance of the religious context in which atheistic positions are developed. The paper is divided into two main parts. The first one focuses on the concept of unbelief, its definition and its methodological potential. Unbelief is a concept particularly used in modern context. However, this paper proposes to apply the term in ancient times. Establishing unbelief as a religious-related field allow us to expand the scope to analyse atheistic positions in “premodern” times. The second part of this analysis is focused on the term “atheism”. In this work, atheism is defined as one of the philosophical positions included in the notion of unbelief. Atheistic positions that consist of denying the nature or the existence of the God or gods are understood as specific philosophical claims of the unbelievers. As so many authors have claimed, atheism cannot be stated as a universal phenomenon. It is a complex position that differs depending on its historical and religious context, especially in how the idea of God or gods has been developed. On the other hand, atheism is not (always) an antireligious position. An unbeliever in the idea of God, an atheist, can be also a believer in other religious elements, for example, soul or a magic force. In that regard, if we connect the complexity of unbelief and the variety of atheism, we can analyse the notion of unbelief in different historical contexts taking into account the peculiarities of each historical “chronotope”, in this case, the religious context of Ancient Greece.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Minority millennials and disaffiliation from religious communities: What unbelief means for millennials in the 21st century,Aprilfaye Manalang,Norfolk State University,Virginia,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Why do America’s youngest generation disaffiliate from religious communities? How do disaffiliated minority millennials and Generation Z (Gen Z) view religion? How do they navigate their largely religious ethnic communities? Previous research has examined the religiosity of communities of color. However, there is a rising trend of unbelief among Gen Z and minority millennials. This research project investigates the diversity of unbelief among minority millennials and Gen Z; specifically, Filipino-Americans, the second-largest Asian-American group; African-Americans; and Hispanic-Americans. Through 45 in-depth interviews, the following three themes emerge across the interviews: 1) Race and Religion: “Fitting In” and Cultural Hegemony or Cultural Incompatibility and Unbelief; 2) Problematic History, Race, and Religion: The Legacy of Slavery; 3) Cultural Cost of Unbelief: Negotiating Family. Gen Z and minority millennials express skepticism due to past histories related to the church and subsequently question whether their respective race “fits in” with their religion. Despite these criticisms, most minority millennials and Gen Z report themselves as spiritual. Culturally, they tend to highly regard their parents and grandparents, who tend to be deeply religious. Because of these intergenerational ties, they are unlikely to “come out” as unbelievers in the church. This paper also explores the secularization theory and finds support for the multiple secularities hypothesis.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Cultural repertoires of nonreligion,Penny Edgell,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a recent summary and review of sociological research on religion, I call for a cultural approach and articulate a research agenda centered on understanding cultural repertoires of religion (religious repertoires). In this paper I argue that a cultural approach to non-religion centered on non-religious repertoires is a useful approach to understanding unbelief.  I explain why this approach avoids the analytical problems associated with a secularization perspective on unbelief, including assumptions of linearity, the idea that unbelief is adequately characterized as an absence or a lack of religion and its attendant associations with community and morality, and the problematic characterization of modernity as entailing a sharp break with the past. Then I outline four ways in which the cultural repertoires approach can focus the attention of researchers in productive ways in growing field of scholarship on unbelief.  First, I discuss how this approach is responsive to the polysemous, contingent, and variable nature of unbelief, which may draw selectively on elements of both religious and secular traditions and combine them in new ways.  Second, I show how this approach directs our attention to unbelief as fostered by an array of organized fields of activity, from explicitly secular to spiritual, religious, and other voluntary organizations.  Third, this approach draws attention to the interconnections between unbelief and practice, including the ritualization and practices of connection and community-building.  Fourth, inherent within this approach is a focus on the importance of understanding variations shaped by national context, regional context, and individuals’ social location within a matrix of identity positions.  In summary, by focusing on nonreligious repertoires, I show that we can make strides in consolidating and expanding our understanding of a classical sociological problem, what C. Wright Mills called the understanding of lives in historical context, by centering the meanings of unbelief within and across social context. ",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Understanding unbelief amongst community organisers in Vancouver, Canada,Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly ‘religious’ and ‘nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
From secular bodies to secular affects: Understanding cultures of unbelief through affect theory,Donovan Schaefer,University of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper considers the relevance of affect theory for exploring cultures of unbelief. In “Is There a Secular Body?” Charles Hirschkind asks if we can identify “a particular configuration of the human sensorium—of sensibilities, affects, embodied dispositions—specific to secular subjects, and thus constitutive of what we mean by ‘secular society’?” (633) Building on the work of scholars such as Saba Mahmood, Ann Pellegrini, and William Connolly—who have begun the task of connecting affect theory and critical secularism studies—I will argue that affect theory offers a new vocabulary for assessing cultures of unbelief according to their plural affective coordinates. As Charles Taylor has written, one of the central tasks of reconsidering secularism is the move away from “subtraction stories,” in which the extrication of religion leaves a neutral landscape of pure reason untouched by the residue of history. Rather than understanding this residue as vestigial conceptual or metaphysical frameworks, affect theory calls attention to the ways historical change may rewrite a set of beliefs while leaving “the way things feel” untouched, or the ways a shift in what Raymond Williams calls “structures of feeling” can alter the social coordinates of a culture while its metaphysical commitments remain constant. This sets up a rich typology for describing cultures of unbelief according to their affective makeup and building more fruitful comparisons (whether focusing on contrast or continuity) with religious cultures. This is illustrated by a historical case study: the initial design of the Sheldonian Theatre in the late 1660s in Oxford. During the middle ages, the University of Oxford primarily relied on the Church of St. Mary the Virgin for corporate activities, including boisterous spectacles like convocation ceremonies. The Sheldonian was commissioned by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, to create a secular site for such events, avoiding the scandal of a single structure wherein “sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo.” (Newman, “The Architectural Setting,” 161) To describe cultures of unbelief, we must not only examine our intuitions about what secularism “feels like,” but also consider the affective topographies that organize different formations of the secular.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
‘Unbelief’ on the ‘Celtic fringe’: A comparative study beyond the city in Scotland and Northern Ireland,Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Scotland and Northern Ireland are constituent regions of the UK that are closely linked by centuries of migration across the North Channel; by problematic entanglements between various forms of Christianity and the state; and by their peripheral position in relation to the locus of UK power. This marginalized position is reflected in the sociological study of religion with many ‘assuming that ‘British society’ is a meaningful and cohesive unity, when, strictly speaking, it has never been that’ (McCrone 2017). Each polity is distinct and multifaceted, yet their historical, social, cultural and religious links, and their shared ‘Celtic fringe’ status, combine to build a strong case for treating them as fruitful sites for the comparative study of ‘unbelief’— ‘used in a wide sense, implying a generalized lack of belief in a God or gods’ (Lee and Bullivant 2016). In this paper, I introduce my ongoing postdoctoral project which conceptualizes ‘unbelief’ as both discursive and political and includes fieldwork in four sites: a village and provincial town in each region. I will first focus upon the methodological hurdles involved in approaching ‘unbelief’ beyond metropolitan centres and argue that contestations surrounding ‘sacred’ values (Knott 2013) can be productive sites for the empirical study of ‘un/belief’. Second, I will address my core research questions considering my ongoing empirical work and analysis: 1) Does ‘unbelief’ look and function in the same way for people from Catholic, Protestant and other religious backgrounds? 2) Does ‘unbelief’ differ between rural areas and metropolitan centres? 3) Do societies characterized by long traditions of Christianity and politicized religious identifications produce particular practices and processes of ‘unbelief’? 4) Where and how do these relate to other social practices and processes of individuals, groups and communities in these two contexts? This paper speaks particularly to theme two of the Cultures of Unbelief conference. It represents an updated version of paper that was accepted for presentation at the BASR-ISASR conference in Belfast, September 2018, which was subsequently withdrawn due to my role as conference organizer and chair of the panel ‘Unbelief Across Borders’.

States and traits: The meaning of uncertainty in nonreligious narratives,Jacqui Frost,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Modernization narratives argue that belief and identity formation in modernity are riddled with uncertainty and instability; certainty is cast as a much desired, but considerably scarce commodity, while states of uncertainty and fluidity are theorized as disorienting and anxiety-inducing. The nonreligious, a sort of bell-weather group for these late-modern secular forms of belief and identity, offer an interesting case for exploring the empirical limits of this ideal-typed “modern” subject. Drawing on an analysis of identity narratives from 50 atheists, agnostics, and other nonreligious Americans, I find that nonreligious organizations and discourses promote both uncertainty and certainty, fostering a spectrum of active identifications and critical uncertainties. I argue that there is more certainty for the nonreligious than our theoretical narratives would predict, much of which is created by the politicization of certainty by nonreligious organizations. I also show that uncertainty and liminality can be intentional nonreligious choices that lead to meaningful worldviews and social engagement. And I reveal how nonreligious individuals often fluctuate between states of certainty and uncertainty regarding their nonreligious beliefs, making it useful to distinguish between certainty and uncertainty as both potentially stable traits as well as transitional or liminal states.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Irish Ex-Catholicism and the Morality of Unbelief,Hugh Turpin,Coventry University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While unbelievers are frequently stereotyped as immoral, moral concerns play a defining role in many unbelieving worldviews. Drawing on a nationally representative survey of baptised Catholics and a year-long period of fieldwork, this presentation describes contemporary Irish ex-Catholicism as a particularly heightened example of moralised unbelief. Survey data suggests that for ex-Catholics, the Catholic Church is primarily associated with basic immorality and unpalatable conservativism. Ethnographic fieldwork and interviews suggest that this moral stance is best understood as a reaction to the intertwining forces of religious scandal, the Church’s influence on social institutions, and ‘cultural Catholicism’, a ‘passive’ and ‘complicit’ force perceived to perpetuate the status quo. The moral quest for full liberation from Catholic influence is the central driving component of ex-Catholicism. This ambition is complicated by the existence of a cultural Catholic ‘ethic of harmony’ which prioritises local traditions while privatising personal unbelief. Against this backdrop, cultural Catholics are sometimes viewed as secret unbelievers who ought to be ‘woken’ into disaffiliation so that the project of secularization can be more swiftly achieved.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Investigating Supernatural Belief and Unbelief Implicitly Using the Affect Misattribution Procedure,Robert Ross,Macquarie University,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Asking about religious beliefs, or lack thereof, is a sensitive and complex issue. In this project we develop and explore a new implicit measure of supernatural belief. In Phase One we adapt the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to measure supernatural beliefs implicitly in an American sample. We find that the strength of associations between supernatural entities (e.g., god, devil, heaven) and the concept “real” (as opposed to the concept “imaginary”) predicts self-reported supernatural belief and self-reported religious behaviour. In Phase Two we use the AMP to study supernatural belief implicitly across eight diverse societies that exhibit high levels of self-reported unbelief. ",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.

Little is known about the types of such ‘unbeliefs’ and their psychological functions, or about their variation globally. In this project, we ran a systematic review to examine the psychological functions of secular beliefs (e.g., coping), and we found similar results to those of religious beliefs, demonstrating the bolstering nature of worldviews more generally. Moreover, we ran an open-ended questionnaire with 100 participants in 10 countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, and Brazil) to survey types of beliefs and worldviews across the globe. In the analysis, we found that these responses roughly fit in eight super-categories: science and critical thinking, natural laws and the here and now, equality and care, collaboration and peace, having (no) control, morality and truth, reflection, (anti-)religion and mysticism.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Material insecurity predicts greater commitment only to moralistic deities: Testing the existential security hypothesis of religious commitment in 14 societies,Benjamin Purzycki,MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology,Germany,M,Adam Baimel,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When, in what ways, and with what intensity do people demonstrate commitment to their gods? The existential security hypothesis predicts that in the absence of more successful secular institutions, people will be attracted to religion when they are materially insecure. Most assessments, however, use group-level data exclusively from state-level societies with world religions. Using individual-level data collected in societies that cover the various scales of human social complexity with diverse religious traditions including animism, shamanism, polytheism, and monotheism, we conducted a systematic cross-cultural test (N = 2027; 14 societies) of the relationship between material security and other relevant demographics (i.e., age, sex, family size, and formal education) and the strength of religious commitment (indexed by two forms of religious commitment - beliefs and practices). In addition to the striking variation we found between demography and religious commitment, we also find support for the existential security hypothesis among moralistic traditions. This support, however, does not extend to other traditions, and in some cases we find the converse, namely, that wealth predicts adherence to local religious traditions. This latter result indicates that material security does not necessarily lead to non­-commitment. ",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Nonreligious childhood: Growing up unbelieving in contemporary Britain,Anna Strhan,University of York,England,F,Rachael Shillitoe,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"What does it mean to be ‘unbelieving’ for children? As numbers of the avowedly nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, this paper presents the main findings from a research project exploring how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be unbelieving, and with whom children learn to be non-religious, and considers the different factors that are implicated in the formation of non-religious identities. While research on religious transmission has demonstrated the importance of family context, our multi-sited approach reveals the important role also played by both school context and children’s own reflections in shaping their formation as non-religious, suggesting a complex pattern of how non-religious socialization is occurring in Britain today. Coupled with this we also explore the varieties of children’s unbelief and how they are constructed in childhood. Data gathered from this study demonstrates the complexities and configurations of children’s unbelief, revealing the different types of beliefs (e.g. Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy) children hold as well as those they do not and what this can tell us about the nature and diversity of unbelief across the lifespan.

The paper draws on the interview-based research among the Estonian unbelievers, conducted in 2018-19 and focuses on three main topics. First of all, I’m trying to understand what counts as “unbelief” in this context, on what assumptions it is based and what does it entail. Second, I’m focusing on the “generations of unbelief”, trying to find out generational patterns and the impact of the Soviet experience on unbelief.

Cultures and politics of nonbelieving in Egypt,Karin van Nieuwkerk,Radbound University,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In Egypt, unbelief has recently become a major concern for religious and political authorities and blasphemy charges are regularly used against expressions of nonbelievers. Accordingly, coming out for nonbelieving is very difficult and sometimes dangerous. However, especially since the 2011-revolution, young people do contest the religious hegemony in the public sphere and speak out about their nonbelieving, particularly in the relatively safe space of social media (or confidential interviews). Leaving Islam is not only a cognitive process but also involves bodily acts, such as removing the veil and changing dietary habits, or transforms social and intimate relationships. Yet several nonbelievers also continue to embody parts of religion in order to ‘pass’ as a Muslim. They accordingly develop ambiguous ways of living unbelief.

Atheism as a vocation: What can socialists teach us about modern belief and unbelief?,Victoria Smolkin,Wesleyan University ,Connecticut,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Though at the time perceived as a period of religious decline and even crisis, the 1960s turned out to be a pivotal period for religious transformation that profoundly shifted the subsequent landscape of both belief and unbelief. One of the defining features of this period was the new willingness of different parties, both believers and unbelievers, to engage in dialogue across confessional and ideological lines. Perhaps the most unexpected and radical dialogue to emerge in this historical moment was between religion and socialism, the antagonism between which had been a structuring principle for religious and political life for more than a century, especially in Europe. We can find these new types of encounters between belief and unbelief in developments like the Christian-Marxist dialogues that emerged in both the West and the Communist world; the establishment and work of the Vatican’s Secretariat on Non-Believers, including its 1969 symposium on “The Culture of Unbelief,” which brought together church leaders, theologians, Marxist philosophers and Western sociologists to discuss the contours of modern belief and unbelief; and – most closely connected with my own work on Soviet atheism, recently published in A Sacred Space Is Never Empty: A History of Soviet Atheism (Princeton University Press, 2018) – the transformation in Soviet understandings and approaches to religion and atheism, evident in the emergence of a new forms of “scientific” and even “spiritual” atheism, new sociological studies of religion, and the identification of religious and ideological “indifference” as the defining feature of the modern religious and ideological landscape.

Reject the myth of disenchantment that has dominated much of the theorizing about modernization and secularization, 2. Expand the definition of enchantment to include “immanent enchantment” and “nonreligious frequencies” that have nothing to do with magic and gods, and 3. Recognize that nonreligious frequencies of meaning are vital to saving the planet.

For instance, the report shows how: Unbelief in God doesn’t necessarily entail unbelief in other supernatural phenomena. Atheists and (less so) agnostics exhibit lower levels of supernatural belief than do the wider populations. However, only minorities of atheists or agnostics in each of our countries appear to be thoroughgoing naturalists (Bullivant, Farias, Lanman and Lee, 2019: 3). The interim findings also shows how on the whole, there are as many similarities as differences between unbelievers and the general population when it come to what is important and what gives meaning in the world, with ‘family’ and ‘freedom’ being the top ranked by both atheists and agnostics, as well as the general population.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Modeling Pathways of Unbelief Across Cultural Contexts,F. LeRon Shults,University of Agder,Norway,M,Thomas J. Coleman III,Coventry University,England,M,Marjaana Lindeman,University of Helsinki,Finland,F,Justin Lane,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will address both of the major questions guiding the “Cultures of Unbelief” conference by outlining the conceptual architectures and initial experimental findings of two computational models of unbelief. Social simulation techniques of the sort to be described here enable researchers to test hypotheses about the ways in which micro-level psychological variables and individual behaviors (such as levels of unbelief and affiliation with in-groups that exclude believers) can lead to the emergence of macro-level sociological phenomena at the population level (such as demographic changes related to unbelief and group affiliation). By constructing simulated agents with psychologically realistic cognitive architectures (and individual variables such as class, age, gender and education) who interact within an “artificial society,” and validating those interactions in light of real-world data sets, researchers can run experiments that explore how different cultural contextual conditions (parameters) can alter the pathways through which individual agents alter their religious beliefs and behaviors. And this is exactly what our research teams have done. At last year’s conference in London, we offered an introduction to the relevant models, which were just underway. Our presentation at the NSRN conference was featured in the most recent issue of Der Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/glaube-was-haelt-religionen-zusammen-was-schwaecht-sie-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000161665903. In the currently proposed paper, we would like to present an update on two models that are directly relevant to the conference theme. The first is a systems-dynamics model of the “analytic” pathway to atheism, which includes parameters that allow us to test how contextual factors (such as presence of religion in the environment) impact this pathway. The second is an agent-based model of CRED theory. In the latter, agents have variables such as gender, education, employment, etc., as well as “worldviews” (religious or nonreligious). We will present the architectures and our initial findings, which help to shed light on “the nature of unbelief” and “the ways in which different types of unbelief” shift across cultural contexts.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Examining the Multidimensional Nature of Unbelief: A Psychological Approach,Sean E. Moore,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this talk, I will describe the theoretical basis and results of a program of research that utilizes a psychological understanding of secularism and nonreligion to identify the nature and types of unbelief present in varying cultural contexts. This approach conceptualizes “unbelief” as a collection of interrelated beliefs, attitudes, and value dimensions that are part of a secular meaning system or worldview. Theoretically, this approach is derived from work that has examined the psychology of worldviews and values, cross-cultural psychology, as well as the existential motivations underlying human belief systems. Methodologically, it relies upon the quantitative, self-report methodologies prominently used in psychological assessment and the psychology of religion. By adopting this kind of approach, researchers can conceptualize secularism and nonreligion as a positive belief system that can be both distinct from and overlapping with religious worldviews. In a set of studies, my research team and I used this framework to explore the multidimensional nature of secularism and nonreligion present in samples of Canadian students and a cross-cultural sample of adult respondents from 24 different nations. Survey items were generated via group discussion of the nature of secular worldviews and review of previously published nonreligion typologies. Analysis of the survey responses identified several common core belief dimensions connected to unbelief (e.g., anti-religion/scientism, secular indifference, humanistic values) that were similar across cultural contexts. There were also several key divergences (e.g., cross-national differences and differences across rural versus urban cultural contexts). Importantly, by adopting this belief system framework, we were also able to identify key underlying cultural attitudes, beliefs, and moral orientations connected to particular dimensions of secularism and nonbelief. For example, the presence of individualistic values and moralities based in fairness/justice concerns were correlated with anti-religious beliefs, while experiences with secular upbringing predicted religious indifference. The implications of these findings and the broader significance of a psychological understanding of unbelief for the burgeoning field of secularism studies will be discussed",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
What do unbelievers believe?: A psychological test of form and function,Thomas J. Coleman III,Coventry University,England,M,Jonathan Jong,Coventry University,England,M,Valerie van Mulukom,Coventry University,England,F,Miguel Farias,Coventry University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Compared to the one thing unbelievers reject (i.e. God), very little is known about what unbelievers actually believe in. Moreover, Farias’s (2013) 'replacement hypothesis' suggests that, whatever these beliefs might be, they may replace the psychological functions commonly associated with religious beliefs. Across three studies, our presentation addresses these issues utilizing a mixed-methodological approach. In study one we ask unbelieving individuals directly, 'if you don't believe in God, then what do you believe in?' Through thematic coding, 4 domains of surrogate beliefs were identified (science, humanistic beliefs, believing in one’s self, and moral realism). In study two, we test how these surrogate beliefs may provide meaning in life and protective benefits against death anxiety and perceived stress. In study three, we partially replicate the previous results and test the possibility that surrogate beliefs provide benefits exclusively to unbelievers by comparing a sample of theists and atheists. These results break new ground in the identification of and psychological utility for distinct unbeliefs",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
“Preach Sistah!!!” – Co-Effecting Third Spaces of Emotive Resonance,Evelina Lundmark,Uppsala University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper looks at a particular culture unbelief using Michael Warner’s (2005) concept of publics and counterpublics. I examine the videos and comment sections of 60 US women or gender queer persons in relation to their experiences of, on the one hand, publicly performing atheist identity in the US context, a culture that strongly ties the idea of good citizenship to religiosity. On the other hand, in relation to what it means to speak out as a woman or gender queer person in a minority discourse dominated by men. I thus explore the particular socio-technical affordances shaping these narratives and their reception in relation to femininity, atheism, and the US context, asking how theories of self-performance, counterpublics, and third spaces in digital religion help us understand what is happening in these types of spaces. In examining and extending Warner’s (2005) model of publics, this paper thus considers how vloggers co-effect third spaces of emotive resonance that enable a precarious counterpublicness of performing atheist visibility, and thus aims to highlight emotive and affective aspects of non-religious identity",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Is Unbelief the New Frontier of Interreligious Dialogue? Religious Literacy in Comparative Context,Justine Ellis,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the past two decades, the concept of religious literacy has gained currency in both scholarly and popular discourse. A trans-Atlantic, Anglophone conversation has emerged as U.S. and U.K. policymakers have called for increased public understanding of religion through educational training programmes within various areas of civil society. In many instances, proponents of religious literacy appear to question unbelievers’ ability to engage with religion, often explicitly citing the idea that the need for religious literacy results from our so-called secular society’s lost ability to interact with religious populations and to identify religious tropes. Against this backdrop, my paper asks what religious literacy could mean within the context of increasing nonreligious populations and a growing awareness of cultures of unbelief. This paper examines the ways in which the U.S. and U.K.’s sociocultural and religious landscapes may inform and impact the representation of unbelief and nonreligion within policy proposals. Taking Christopher Cotter’s (2018) call to bridge the gap between critical religion and the growing area of scholarship on nonreligion, this paper examines the ways in which the constructed categories of religion and nonreligion are treated in comparative contexts of U.S. and U.K. religious literacy proposals. This paper suggests that defining what constitutes religion is not simply an ontological project in this instance. Rather, since religious literacy is by definition rooted in the practical and the practicable, examining what gets included and what gets left off the table has consequences for the presentation of religion and nonreligion in such training programmes. Arguing that the problem and implications of defining religion (and delineating nonreligion) have not been faced fully in policy proposals, this paper contends that religious literacy trainings provide a site from which to question the ethic of inclusion in the growing discussion around how people with and without religious beliefs will collaborate and enter into dialogue",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Reimagining the Imaginaries: Towards a Biocultural Theory of Nonreligion,Mari Ovsepyan,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A number of scholars of nonreligion and secularity have argued in recent years for the need to get beyond the neat binaries and the negative identities signaled by atheism and agnosticism (e.g., Taves, Asprem & Ihm, 2018). Charles Taylor in his seminal work A Secular Age (2007) makes a famous case against the ‘subtraction stories’ expressed in the popular narrative as a mere reduction of religious belief. Taylor’s interpretation is deeply psychological and gives an account of the radical transformation of the social imaginaries that shape the way we conceptualize the world we inhabit. However, there is little attention given to the non-cognitive aspects of the social imaginaries in recent scholarship. Kathleen Lennon argues that imaginaries should be defined as the ‘bearers of affective significance, the means by which we not only think but feel our way around that world’ (Lennon, 2004: 111). Conceptualizing imaginaries as a way of collective production of sense offers a helpful way of engaging with the question of how differently historied bodies come to experience and engage with the world in different ways, and leads to the possibility of thinking about the role of imaginaries in constituting different minds and different bodies with different capacities. In this paper I will argue that the language of social imaginaries is helpful for building a bridge between the cognitive and affective elements of nonreligion. I will engage with the recent work of cognitive anthropologists Tanya Luhrmann and Even Danziger on metacognitive diversity and the ‘local theories of mind’ and the role they play in religious experience to argue that a more polyvalent way of approaching social imaginaries offers a helpful contribution to the biocultural theory of both religion and non-religion.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
Understanding unbelief in the mindfulness subculture,Masoumeh Sara Rahmani,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Mindfulness meditation has entered the British and American mainstream culture as a secular, scientific technique that supports both physical and mental health. Consequential to its secular framing, mindfulness has been particularly appealing to non-religious peoples who seek out this practice as means to improve their well-being. Yet, for many people, Mindfulness can become more than a mere technique; it can become a major source of meaning in their lives, informing their values, reshaping their self-concept, and even altering their conceptions of the world and their relations with transcendent realities. This paper draws on in-depth and longitudinal interviews with meditators in the UK and the US to explore the range of non-believer identities and outlooks that are constituted in the Mindfulness subculture. In particular, it traces the influence of the practice on the meditators’ worldviews, asking: To what extent, and in which direction, does the practice steer the trajectory of their lives? It then depicts the common patterns of change in the nonreligious outlooks – such as transit from positive atheism to secular Buddhism and strong agnosticism – as they increase their engagement with Mindfulness and its teachings.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.
What “implicit belief” can tell us about the nature and ubiquity of not believing,Jamin Halberstadt,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,Jesse Bering,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although motivational theories in the field emphasize the importance of defending religious beliefs, our previous research suggests that unbelief, for some people, is an equally coherent and functional worldview, which they will be highly motivated to defend. To study such defense, we have developed a semi-structured interview procedure to probe for seemingly inexplicable events (e.g., premonitory dreams, sightings of apparitions, out-of- body experiences). In a pilot study involving over 200 American participants (mostly unbelievers of several varieties that we did not distinguish), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events (often involving purported ghosts or paranormal phenomena) that challenged that belief. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the frequency with which they experience challenging events, the types of challenging experiences that they reported, and finally how they have reconciled them with their existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we have established a framework for classifying both participants’ experiences, and their strategies for defending their worldviews. Overall 33% (n=238) of extinctivists reported having had experiences that challenged their afterlife beliefs. The most frequently reported type of experience involved encounters with ghosts or spirits. other represented categories included: near death experiences, out of body experiences, unexplainable dreams, religious experiences, precognitions, and hallucinations. The majority of participants reconciled these experiences with their extinctivist worldview by attributing them to cognitive failings or flights of imagination.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.

Practicing without believing? Expressions of sacred in human relationships amongst Japanese unbelievers: its consistency and inconsistency,Yutaka Osakabe,Sophia University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ama (1996) among others explain an enigma between Japanese expressions of religious unbelief and participation in religious rituals in a context where they do not associate such participation with religion, but with more generic terms such as culture, tradition, custom or event. My interviews support their claim; they make sense of their contradictions in a similar narrative. Although this might signal absence of strong belief in religion or, even culture, my research also highlights a variety of more committed beliefs in relationships with people around them, such as family, children, neighbours and humanity in general. For example, whilst some immediately reject existence of angels, ghosts or spirits of gods, they hesitate to do so with spirits of ancestors because such rejection seems disrespectful even if they admit that they only believe in what they can actually see. A belief in relationships generates a particular kind of narratives when they negotiate different values in complex moral and political questions, forming distinctive godless ethics, mostly in a consistent way with their belief in human relationships over gods, but sometimes inconsistently.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.

The figures seem a bit surprising for a country that has seen a rise in the numbers of atheists and non-religious people in the past few decades. It’s commonly assumed that Britain has become “disenchanted”, in the sense that people no longer believe, as their forbears once did, in gods, ghosts and spirits that animate the world. Closely related is another assumption: that now we have more-or-less “subtracted” our shared public religious understandings of the world, we will be left with the “genuine deliverance of science, the truth about things, including ourselves, which was waiting all along to be discovered.” My aims are twofold: 1) to better characterise enchantment in our so-called scientific age and 2) to explore whether various enchanted worldviews have any consequences for how people receive and act upon scientific advice."

It is also a question at the heart of the study of religion. How people relate to the question of eating animals is pivotal in many religions and embedded in theological questions concerning human relationships with and responsibilities towards nonhuman creation. But how should we approach the question of eating animals in a world where nonreligion is thriving? Does the rapid rise of nonreligion change how people relate to the nonhuman world, or even who we eat?"
Beneath the Surface: A Critique of the Common Survey Model in the Study of Nonreligion,Elisa Järnefelt,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When measuring nonreligiosity, a common approach is to ask about the participants’ religious or nonreligious affiliation and belief in God. In this critical commentary, this type of methodological approach – referred as the “survey model” – is first placed in its historical context. The article suggests that understanding the historical context and cultural function of the survey model illuminates various theoretical and methodological limitations that have been previously recognized in multiple areas of research from the study of religion and sociology to survey methodology and cognitive sciences. Based on this interdisciplinary review, it is noted that, if relying on the survey model in either qualitative or quantitative research, the studies are likely to sustain the cultural categories of “religion” and “nonreligion” that, paradoxically, are implicitly defined by the survey model, and remain at the level of reputation management. To overcome these limitations and allowing researchers to assess cultural and cognitive aspects of the forming and construing of a human phenomenon like nonreligiosity, the article emphasizes the importance of multimethodology along with an interdisciplinary theoretical framework.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
The Arbiters of Faith: Legislative Assembly of BC Entanglement with Religious Dogma Resulting from Legislative Prayer,Ian Bushfield,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,Teale N. Phelps Bondaroff,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Daily sittings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (BC), Canada begin with a prayer or reflection delivered by a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). MLAs have the option of using a sample prayer from a list of five provided by Legislative staff, or of delivering a prayer of their own devising. The Office of the Clerk is currently revising the list of sample prayers to include a greater diversity of beliefs. To accomplish this task, bureaucrats face a number of practical and constitutional challenges. This article explores these challenges. The Office of the Clerk will have to first identify religious and belief groups that are present in BC, then select a reasonable number of those groups to include on the list, and finally identify prayers and reflections that are representative of those traditions. Each of these steps raises practical questions with respect to how bureaucrats can actually make these decisions, and to more fundamental questions regarding the appropriateness of the decisions made. Given these challenges, this paper concludes that the practice of offering sample prayers should be avoided, and that MLAs should be called upon to deliver prayers and reflections of their own devising, or that legislative prayer be abolished.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.

This question is especially significant as both countries experience increasing (non)religious diversity, particularly in regions once dominated by various Christian traditions that now find their proportionate representation of the population on the decline. Drawing upon a range of survey and interview data, two key findings stand out in our research. First, atheists—as a subset of religious nones—and evangelicals reserve their strongest negative views for one another. This polarization is present in both the United States and Canada, but is especially pronounced in the United States. Second, religious nones generally hold more negative views toward perceived “exclusive” groups, and positive views toward perceived “inclusive” groups."
The Meaning of 'Secular’ as a Scientific Concept,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The meaning of 'secular’ in the scientific use of 'secular trend’, 'secular variation’, and similar terms is a topic that merits historical investigation. The scientific meaning for 'secular’ has an origin and independent role apart from both religion and secularization. Fields in the social sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences have been using the concepts of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ for almost two centuries. The field of economics was the first among the social sciences, while epidemiology was the first in the life sciences. Both disciplines adapted the use of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ from the earth sciences, which borrowed the idea of 'secular’ from astronomy. Early astronomical texts first used 'secular’ to describe 'secular inequalities’ and 'secular variations’ in long-term patterns to celestial motions. Astronomers had found saeculum to be a convenient Latin word from ancient Rome to refer to a century’s duration. This article recounts the intellectual history of the scientific uses, which continue to lack a relationship with anything religious to the present day.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.

Rather, they are human beings with their own biases and commitments that inevitably inform their work. Even if this fact is uncontroversial, the authority of “The Dictionary” still looms over contemporary discussions about the meaning of words. This makes it important to look at the historical process by which these meanings were formed."

His utterance occurs historically about half-way between Nietzsche’s infamous declaration of the death of God and these two modern phenomena. His short sentence draws some of its meaning from its immediate context (his essay against occultism), but also from its broader context, the Hegelian notion of the World Spirit. Most significantly, though, it is a highly prescient insight, baldly formulated, and arguably more far-reaching than the madman’s 'God is dead.’ References are made to various thinkers in the past two hundred years to elucidate some of the possible nuances of Adorno’s statement. Both modern atheism and contemporary anatheism can be illuminated as pivoting around Adorno’s shrewd observation.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.

The latter camp argues that atheism does not include a set of socio-political markers that sets it off from other movements; it is mainly a science- and reason-based philosophy challenging belief in the supernatural that can be adapted to a wide range of political orientations. We find this view increasingly reflected among both atheist and secular humanist leaders and publications, especially in the “new atheist” movement, which has drawn high proportions of atheists interested in science. In this paper, we will examine the political discourse and views of atheist leaders and opinion-makers and those of members of atheist-secular humanist organizations during and after the 2016 elections.

It is almost inevitable that the survey author will realize that they forgot to ask about a specific topic, did not offer enough response options, or did not fully investigate a possible question ordering effect. However, oftentimes these oversights can be seen as opportunities. In the 2010 wave of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, when individuals were asked about their present religion, the response options did not include a choice for atheists, which is present in all other waves of the CCES. If an atheist was taking the questionnaire in 2010 and did not see the optimal choice that described their religious affiliation, what was their backup option? Using both descriptive analysis and machine learning techniques, we try to determine where these misplaced atheists went in the 2010 CCES. In general, we found that the vast majority chose one of the other religiously unaffiliated options: agnostics or nothing in particular, but a significant minority chose another religious tradition.

Given this representation, mindfulness meditation is particularly appealing to unbelievers (e.g., atheists, agnostics, and nones) who desire self-transformation yet wish to keep traditional religions at arm’s length. Two years ago, my colleagues and I started a longitudinal, mixed-method project funded by the Understanding Unbelief program to explore the diversity of unbelief in the mindfulness subcultures of the UK and the US and answer a question unsettling to most practitioners and advocates of this practice: “is mindfulness a secular religion for unbelievers?” In this piece, I summarise the qualitative findings of this two-year study and argue that mindfulness meditation commonly functions as a gateway to secular Buddhism and that mindfulness is best seen as a “scientific spirituality.”"

Historically, Black women have relied on churches and faith-based institutions as vehicles for political organizing, cultural identity, and community solidarity. It is for this reason, as well as the slave-era stigma associated with Black female sexuality, that being a Black female humanist and atheist is even more taboo than being a Black male atheist. Dehumanized as either hyper-sexual Jezebels or asexual Aunt Jemimas, Black women have been constructed as less moral, less human, less chaste, and less civilized than respectable white Christian women. “Going Godless” will examine this history vis-à-vis the emergence of Black feminist humanist perspectives in the American secular humanist and atheist movements. For example, how have Black women humanists and atheists drawn on the feminist/womanist legacy of writers and thinkers like Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Nella Larsen?

Imaginary Friends and Made-Up Stories: How to Explore (Non)Religious Imaginaries Without Asking Belief-Centred Questions,Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.

This social phenomenon has evoked competing explanations, many of which enjoy empirical support. We synthesize six of the most influential social-science explanations, demonstrating that they provide complementary perspectives on a complex causal architecture. We incorporate this theoretical synthesis into a computer simulation, identifying conditions under which the predominant attitude toward supernaturalism in a population shifts from acceptance to rejection (and vice versa). The model suggests that the conditions for producing widespread rejection of supernatural worldviews are highly specific and difficult to produce and sustain. When those conditions combine, which is historically rare, a stable social equilibrium emerges within which post-supernaturalist worldviews are widespread; however, this equilibrium is easier to disrupt than equilibria whose cohesion is stabilized by supernatural religion due to persistent cognitive tendencies toward supernaturalism in evolved human minds.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.
(Non)Religious Coping with a Natural Disaster in a Rural U.S. Community,Dena Abbott,University of Nebraska,Nebraska,F,Andrew Franks,Pacific Lutheran University/Central Michigan University,Washington/Michigan,M,Corey Cook,Pacific Lutheran University,Washington,M,Caitlin Mercier,Louisiana Tech University,Louisiana,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Religious/spiritual (R/S) coping following natural disasters is associated with positive outcomes, leading to perceptions that the absence of R/S coping leads to negative outcomes among nonreligious individuals. However, little research explicitly explores the coping strategies of nonreligious individuals in response to natural disasters and traumatic events. The present study collected data from a sample of survivors of a natural disaster event (i.e., a tornado) to test the relationship between (non)religiosity/(non)spirituality, coping, psychological distress, and posttraumatic growth. Statistical models suggested that problem-focused coping facilitated posttraumatic growth and lower levels of psychological distress among people with lower levels of institutional religiousness and/or individual spirituality (consistent with predictions), but not among people at high levels of religiousness/spirituality (contrary to predictions). Participants with moderate levels of institutional religiousness reported more dysfunctional coping and higher levels of psychological distress, as predicted. Emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer depressive symptoms following trauma among participants with low levels of institutional religiousness. These data suggest a complex relationship between trauma, posttraumatic growth, distress, and coping among varying levels of (non)religiousness/(non)spirituality. This study is among the first to suggest that problem-focused coping in particular may promote positive psychological outcomes among nonreligious/nonspiritual people following a natural disaster or traumatic event. Implications of these data (i.e., for treatment of trauma) are discussed.",2021,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,10,.,.
Mapping Scholarly Affinities in the Academic Study of Non-Religion and Secularity,Dominik Balazka,University of Milan/University of Turin,Italy,M,Dario Rodighiero,Harvard University,Massachusetts,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network (NSRN) is a central organization for the emerging field of non-religion studies.

To better understand this community, an interactive tool was conceived to visualize and navigate over 250 scientific contributions (2008-2020) collected from NSRN’s events, blog, book series, and journal. The distribution of scholars in the space is based on lexical distance, so spatial proximity expresses a similarity measure of authors' dictionaries. Isoclines represent an indicator of relevance based on word frequency. Unlike citation analysis, lexical proximity relies on shared verbal units rather than potentially misleading academic hierarchies. By shifting the attention from citations to discourse and word usage, lexical proximity uncovers new configurations of scholars.

Using agent-based simulations in three “artificial societies” (one predominantly religious; one predominantly secular; and one in between), we demonstrate that worldview pluralism within one’s neighborhood and family social networks can be a significant predictor of religious (dis)affiliation but in pluralistic societies worldview diversity is less important and, instead, people move toward worldview neutrality. Our results suggest that there may be two phases in religious disaffiliation: (1) the early adopters initially disaffiliate regardless of social support, and subsequently (2) disaffiliation spreads as support for it within local social networks widens and it appears more acceptable. An important next step is for sociologists to confirm or correct the theoretical findings of this model using real-world social-network data, which will require overcoming the measurement difficulties involved in estimating each individual’s degree of local network pluralism.",2021,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,10,.,.
The “Take a Knee” NFL Movement and the Gesture of Kneeling: From Religious Reverence to Secular Protest,Mathilde Vanasse-Pelletier,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this blog, Mathilde Vanasse-Pelletier looks at the issues raised by the secular appropriation of the religious gesture of kneeling by protesters in the National Football League (NFL).",2021,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Throughout history, the gesture of kneeling – or genuflection – has been ascribed various meanings in different social and cultural contexts. Popularized in the Middle Ages, it was used religiously to represent a sense of remorse for one’s sins or feelings of confidence, loyalty, love, and worship.[1] While genuflection was never restricted to a religious context, often being used symbolically in political rituals, scholars agree that its universal connotation is one of respect, deference, humility, vulnerability,[2] and belittling of one’s self.[3] Members of different faiths today still kneel as part of several religious and spiritual rituals, such as collective and individual prayer in the Christian and Muslim traditions. More recently, genuflection has been used with a secular, or nonreligious, twist after the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick chose to take a knee during the US national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. While kneeling is often constructed as a religious gesture – including in the world of football where it is frequently used by athletes partaking in individual and collective prayer rituals – the participants in this study never referred to genuflection in the context of the protests as a religious act, but rather as a nonreligious act of contestation. Overall, my results show that despite the backlash received by NFL protesters from critics who believe their kneeling is a sign of disrespect to the US national anthem, the flag, and the military, insiders from the world of professional football tend to see the kneeling as 1) a show of unity and solidarity; 2) as a way to mourn for the lives lost due to acts of police brutality against people of color; and 3) as a tool to bring awareness to the issue of racism in the United States."
Lived Nonreligions on Screen. Popularizing Nonreligiosity in Contemporary Seriality,Ilaria Biano,Independent scholar,Italy,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In 2009, anthropologist S. Elizabeth Bird wrote in Diane Winston’s volume Small Screen Big Picture. Television and Lived Religion “TV drama is demonstrably hostile to atheism, which is essentially seen as an extreme and immoral philosophy” arguing also that atheist or nonreligious characters were portrayed only or principally in comedies and in most of the cases in a negative way “as almost a form of pathology.” In the last decade, however, the portrayal of religion in television (American, but not only) has changed in significant ways and one of the most interesting aspects is not only a new interest in discussing in a more or less open way religious or spiritual aspects of everyday life, but most of all the growing presence of nonreligious arguments and characters in central roles as well as confrontations among different worldviews. Building, on the one hand, on the concepts of everyday and lived nonreligion and, on the other, on a critical approach to the representation of (non)religion in the media and specifically in seriality, this paper will examine some examples from series of different genres (such as True Detective, Community, Sense8, Orange is the New Black) showing how they manage to depict different ways of being religious and nonreligious and how these differences are represented and mediated.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
The Good Place: A Case Study for How Non-Religious Ethics is Conceptualized in the United States,Hannah McKillop,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Over the last 30 years the number of Americans who identify as non-religious has increased by 200%. Many assume that “nones” do not share a specific ethical ideology. This project hypothesizes a) that Levinas’ notion of the Other is central to nonreligious moral ethics, and b) that contemporary popular culture, including television, both reflects and shapes the ethical stance of “nones” in North America. When television programs engage with nonreligious questions like “how can I be a good person if I am not religious?,” their responses offer insight into how nonreligious Americans make moral and ethical decisions. This paper will argue that the television show The Good Place offers insight into how nonreligious Americans understand nonreligious morality and ethics outside of a strictly religious framework due to its nonreligious representation of the afterlife.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Humor has been used in a wide variety of contexts to debunk religious beliefs, but we argue that comedy and humor was strategically used by atheist leaders to advance their goals of secularizing a largely religious America at the turn of the millennium. We will focus on professional atheist and agnostic comedians and how their routines have influenced the discourse of atheist leaders and laypeople. Using the methods of textual analysis of comedy performances and a survey of atheists involved in secularist organizations, we will show how such performers used irreverence as an emotion as well as an attitude seeking to break taboos and challenge perceptions of the “establishment” and consensus reality of religion.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Both groups value the environment but there are some differences in how religious and nonreligious individuals conceptualize nature. We examine these differences drawing on a convenience sample of individuals 18+ in the US. We find that religious individuals are more likely to believe humans are stewards of nature while nonreligious individuals are more likely to see humans as part of nature or that nature is in control. We find very few differences between the religious and nonreligious when examining what they obtain from the time they spend in nature walking, hiking, or trekking. There are no differences in obtaining peace of mind, connection, escaping from normal life, or socializing with others. There are minor differences in desiring to protect the environment, finding time to reflect, and feeling a sense of enchantment.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

The data consists of interviews with 42 people living in Canada and Finland. I analyse food related talk as an ethical narrative that articulates moral subject positions. By putting empirical data in dialogue with new materialist food waste research, the findings illustrate that humans are assigned roles as both creators of food waste and saviours of food that is in danger of going to waste. Further, in order to trouble these anthropocentric notions, the study detects a third role: the garburator role illuminates the corporeality of humans in food waste relations; the specific human bodies that bear responsibility in food waste relations; and the embodied limits of humans in these relations. The findings point out the persistent anthropocentric tendencies in human/non-human relations in increasingly nonreligious societies, as well as potential ways to complicate these tendencies.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Ethical Veganism and Nonreligion in Casamitjana Costa v The League Against Cruel Sports,Lauren Strumos,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In January 2020, an employment tribunal in the United Kingdom decided that ethical veganism qualified for protection from discrimination as a philosophical belief under the UK’s Equality Act 2010. This paper explores the reasoning behind this judgement, as presented in the preliminary hearing decision for Mr J Casamitjana Costa v The League Against Cruel Sports, to argue that ethical veganism in this context can be conceptualized as a form of nonreligion. It specifically uses relational theories of nonreligion to demonstrate how the tribunal constructs ethical veganism to be distinct from religion, while also positioning it into various relationships with religion. This relational approach offers insights into how the law draws on religion to imagine and define beliefs that are not explicitly or essentially religious. Further, this paper considers the diversity of ethical veganism as an identity and practice, paying particular attention to the ways in which veganism as lived intersects with religion and nonreligion.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Health and Wellbeing Among the Nonreligious: Accounting for the Nonreligious Life Course,Jacqui Frost,Rice University,Texas,F,Penny Edgell,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,Mahala Miller,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"There is a long history of research in the sociology of religion that links good health and wellbeing to religious affiliation and participation. When compared to a catch-all category of “nones,” the religious are often found to be happier, healthier, and to have a greater sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. Recent research by nonreligion scholars that accounts for the diversity of the nonreligious has upended these assumptions, showing that some subgroups of nonreligious people, particularly atheists, are just as happy and healthy as religious people. In this paper, we contribute to these discussions by analyzing how the nonreligious life course matters for health and wellbeing. Drawing on new survey data that includes measures of respondents’ comfort with their nonreligion and how recently they became nonreligious, we show that much of the variation in health and happiness among the nonreligious is moderated by how long a respondent has been nonreligious. We find that the longer someone has been nonreligious, the more comfortable they are with their nonreligion, and that the more comfortable a respondent is with their nonreligion, the more likely they are to report good health and wellbeing.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Vulnerability and Human Relations: Non-Religious Responses to Religious Requests in Emergency Departments,Bertrand Lavoie,McGill University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Emergency Departments (ED) are critical care units that receive hundreds of patients every day with different life paths and who share religious and non-religious values. The daily life of an ED is complex because of three major imperatives: the management of entries and exits in order to maintain an acceptable level of care, the need to respond adequately to critical cases involving situations of high vulnerability, and the time constraint, which conditions the clinical activities of the teams. The objective of this presentation is to detail the non-religious responses given by ED workers to requests made by vulnerable patients in relation to the respect of their religious obligations (e.g. compliance with prohibitions on religious holidays, religious diets or on-site rituals). This presentation is based on two years of ethnographic research (2018 to 2020) conducted with 50 participants (22 nurses, 19 physicians and 9 interveners) from four EDs in Montreal and the Eastern Townships (Canada), including nearly 250 hours of in situ observations.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Schram,University of Waterloo,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The circumstances and restrictions on social gatherings that emerged in response to Covid-19 have necessitated the suspension of in-person meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, forcing a migration to Zoom-based meetings. This migration has posed new challenges, including accessibility to applicable technologies, potential for technological illiteracy, and privacy concerns. It has also introduced a new international network of online meetings to nonreligious populations that were previously restricted from participating due to their location. We extend our analysis with new lines of enquiry into secular affect, contrasting pre-Covid-19 observational and interview data with newly collected data from the same participants after their move to online meetings. Leveraging current conditions, we explore the affective dimensions of online secular AA meetings, and consider how telecommunication platforms may impel productive integration into existing recovery programs.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Our results suggest that people identifying as atheist were inconsistently more likely to report having a visual, hearing, mobility, memory, or psychological impairment than people who were non-atheists (trivial-to-small effects). However, when comparing respondents on their level of impairment for activities of daily living, we found that atheism was not associated with severity. Atheists were comparably healthy to non-atheists, which is inconsistent with the widely accepted ‘belief-as-benefit effect’ (i.e., religion/spirituality is salutary).",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Second, I analyze trends in how secular joiners and religiously unaffiliated Americans identify themselves regarding religious, spiritual, and secular labels, as well as their racial and political identifications. As institutional religious affiliations have declined among the general population, diversity within the nonreligious has increased, and it has become ever more important for scholars to understand this group in ways that are religion-related but not religion-centric.

Using the Secular Community Survey and the Secular Voices Survey, the former a poll of secular affiliates, and the latter a representative sample of religiously unaffiliated, we explore the extent to which membership in secular movement organizations influences or hinders political engagement and influences political views, partisanship, and ideology.

It argues that secular people face a special challenge: they need to avoid religion to be secular, but living in the remainder of a broad definition of religion is very restrictive. How do secular people negotiate this tension between avoiding religion and not allowing the need for its absence to structure their lives? Are anti-religious people willing to engage in religion-like behaviors if they seem sufficiently secular? What are the characteristics of the very secular people who are most likely to embrace a secularized form of religion, and what sort of secular people are likely to avoid anything that remotely resembles religious belief or behavior? The Secular Communities Survey is the first attempt to answer these questions with quantitative methods, and this paper will present its findings.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
"Ritual Without the Ritual? Secular People at Birth, Death, and In-Between",Courtney Applewhite,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper considers how secular people engage with life-cycle rituals. In many societies, importance is placed on rituals at birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death. In the United States, these events often have a religious tint. Secular people also experience life-cycle transitions and must make choices in how they mark these events. Drawing on data from the Secular Communities Survey (SCS), we explore how secular people adapt what may be viewed as religious ritual to accommodate their secular beliefs and values. In particular, death rituals are instances in which the transition from living to dead is acknowledged. I argue that this ontological moment is a window into the nexus of belief, practice, and sociality that secular people must reconcile. Using the SCS’s quantitative data, I examine how factors such as organizational involvement, familial preferences, or personally-held beliefs contribute to the choice to participate in, modify, or avoid certain life-cycle rituals.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

The present study is based on deductive or directed qualitative content analysis which identifies key categories already described in theory and tries to apply them in the Croatian social context, seeking new insights and a deeper understanding.

“Apostatizing Together”: Feminist Collective Apostasies in Argentina and Spain,Julia Martínez-Ariño,University of Groningen,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last few years, feminist movements in Argentina and Spain have enlarged their mobilization repertoires with so-called “feminist apostasies”—group performances in local bishoprics to formally request to leave the Catholic Church. This form of collective action is used to protest against the patriarchal nature and structures of the Catholic institution and its stance on issues such as abortion, LGBTQI+ rights and sexual abuse scandals. Drawing on ethnographic and visual material and interviews with feminist apostates, in this presentation I will examine the practices, discourses and material objects around feminist collective apostasies. I understand them as political mobilizations which aim at generating an impact on public debates around the role of the Church in society. My approach, therefore, differs from that of the literature on “deconversion” that focuses on the rejection of faith, practice and community, and adopts a novel perspective on apostasy as a type of political action.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

The non-religious movement has a problem with gender balance—quite a visible one. Although some of the most prominent figures of non-religion in Australia are women, like the Member of Parliament for the Reason Party Coalition, Fiona Patten, most members of the Australian non-religious community are white middle-aged men. This has an impact on the dynamics, culture and reach within those groups. Drawing on preliminary analysis of interviews with 30 women affiliated with humanist and atheist groups in Australia, I will focus on the women’s experiences of gender equality in local non-religious communities. I argue that despite non-religious organisations often claiming otherwise, misogyny and gender inequality is a widespread but subtle issue in these groups in Australia. This is the reason for the gender imbalance in the community.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
The Atheist Movement and Politics in Brazil.

The process and its outcome –the election of the right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro as the new president– highlighted a sharp polarization among the atheist activists. On the one hand, those who opposed its leadership alleging that his alliance with the increasingly powerful evangelical sector and his explicit Christian discourse were incoherent with unbelievers’ rights and interests. On the other hand, those who vindicated the possibility to vote for a religious figure as Bolsonaro despite their positions and advocacy as active atheists, prioritizing their socio-economical views. In fact, since its beginnings in the first decade of the new millennium, the Brazilian atheist movement made the laicity of the State its main flag. The concept is understood as a strict separation between churches and State, and the movement struggles to reduce the historical influence of the Catholic Church and the increasing influence of evangelical churches and leaders in public affairs.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Let the Entire People Avenge the Crime of Blasphemy: Atheism and Moral Panic in Medieval Europe,Keagan Brewer,Macquarie University,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Because medieval Europeans did not have a word exactly equivalent to modern English ‘atheism’, some historians have dismissed or downplayed the possibility of atheism in the Middle Ages. The Latin terms infidelis and incredulis, ‘unfaithful’ or ‘unbelieving’ (with connotations of modern English ‘infidel’), were indeed applied to Jews, Muslims, and Christians that believed or behaved improperly according to those making the claim. However, in this paper, I examine case studies of moral panic, abuse, and violence following atheist speech-acts, which reveals that medieval people did in fact believe that it was possible for an individual to have an enduring and deep-seated rejection of the existence of God. Medieval atheists did not need a word of exactly equivalent meaning to argue that God did not exist. I also argue that moral panic is a fundamental feature of religious group mentalities that perpetuates the group’s sociopolitical cohesion when it is threatened by atheist speech. For that reason, all atheist speech-acts in the Middle Ages were incredibly emotive for both the speaker and hearer.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Alexander,Independent scholar,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper sketches out the foundation for a forthcoming book project which examines the politics of atheism from a historical perspective. Atheism has never purely concerned ideas about God. Rather, political arguments have often flowed from atheist ones, and vice versa. The key question is whether there is any kind of “core” to atheist politics. I propose there are two interrelated aspects to atheist politics. The first is a rejection of certain kinds of authority, namely those based upon theist worldviews such as the divine right of kings. The second is an oppositional, contrarian ethos, in part because of the fact that atheists have often, though not always, been a persecuted minority group. These two aspects can lead in diverse directions, including to socialism, liberalism, and libertarianism. The paper draws upon historical examples to make these points.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
The Complex Intersections of Hate: Exploring the Nonreligious and Religious Aspects of Contemporary Antisemitism,Megan Hollinger,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary antisemitism is a form of hate that is comprised of both religious and nonreligious elements. Often, different forms of hate are separated based on monolithic motivations such as religion, race, and ethnicity amongst others. Antisemitism, as well as Jewish identity are not solely defined by religion. In other words, many Jewish people construct their identity and experience anti-Jewish hatred in nonreligious ways as well. This paper focuses mostly on the Canadian context and argues that it is vital to acknowledge the nonreligious aspects of antisemitism in order to combat it effectively. To demonstrate this, it examines several examples of nonreligiously-motivated antisemitism. Some of the areas in which we observe these complexities are law, online, and with data collection and statistics. The examples are therefore drawn mainly from legal cases and social media. This paper also highlights some of the complexities that arise from promoting monolithic conceptualizations of antisemitism.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Pandemic Non-Religion and Prayer for the Nation: Fantastic or ‘phantasmagorical’?,Anja Finger,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the course of the pandemic, quasi-metaphysical arguments about the anthropological necessity of religion have been revived, yet sceptical voices contend that suggestions of a religious renaissance are premature and religious wishful thinking rather than a reflection of empirical evidence. This paper analyses contemporary discourses of non-religion in the context of the Covid-19 crisis. More specifically, I am going to look at the recent Prayer for the Nation initiative: The Church of England has invited the ‘nation’ to ‘call on God in prayer’, irrespective of whether that nation’s members share the church’s faith – or any faith. While nominally all are invited, the prayer form and its contents are exclusionary. Although there is some rhetorical acknowledgment of diversity, it seems that a positive contribution to coexistence is limited insofar as the initiative does not attempt to translate its religious semantics into a more generally accessible language.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

I present data which explores the connection between nonreligion and cultural religion in modern-day Denmark. Based on exploratory analyses, I discuss how we may perceive nonreligion and cultural religion, inspired by new theoretical understandings of religion and nonreligion, which are increasingly focused on how (non)religious identities, beliefs and practices can be understood as incongruent, shifting and situated (Chaves 2010, Taves 2018). Rather than fitting individuals into distinct categories, I suggest that we may think of (non)religion as a broader continuum on which individuals are oscillating, depending on whether they are e.g. expressing individual, nonreligious worldviews or are participating in collective, culturally religious identities, and that such theorizing could help us understand “the Scandinavian Paradox” as well as nonreligion generally.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Atheists in Greek Society: Beliefs About Religion and Morality in a Greek-Orthodox Context,Alexandros Sakellariou,Hellenic Open University/Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences of Athens,Greece,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Greek society is predominantly Greek-Orthodox and the Orthodox Church still plays an important and influential role on societal and political issues. In 2012, however, an Atheist Union was founded in Greece and many people started to discuss about their atheism or non-belief in the public sphere and the media. This paper builds upon the findings of a qualitative research conducted through 59 semi-structured interviews with people self-characterised as atheists or agnostics. The main questions that are going to be answered in this paper are: Who are the Greek atheists in contemporary Greek society? Which are their beliefs about God, religion, and the Orthodox Church? How do they understand morality and how does this impact their life meaning? The main purpose of this paper is to cast light on Greek atheists’ beliefs on religion and morality and understand how these beliefs shape their atheist identity as they move away from Greek-Orthodoxy.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
"Nonreligious Identities: A Cross-Cultural Qualitative Empirical Study with Nonreligious Individuals in Belgium, Greece and Norway",Sofia Nikitaki,KU Leuven,Belgium,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will present the results of an in-depth, qualitative research containing 64 in-depth interviews with nonreligious individuals from Flanders (Belgium), Greece and Norway. The questions explored in this study focused on two main aspects: the ways that the research participants understand and define their own nonreligious positions (1) and the ways they understand, relate and react to religion-related concepts and terms, such as ‘god’, ‘higher power’ and ‘spirituality’, as well as various forms of religious expressions (2). Furthermore, a secondary focus of this research was to explore whether there are indications of a relation between the manner nonreligion is expressed and the cultural background of the research participants. This presentation aims into briefly discussing the aforementioned topics, paying special attention to the variations of nonreligious expressions in relation to the three countries studied.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Mapping Non-Religious Childhood,Rachael Shillitoe,University of Birmingham,England,F,Anna Strhan,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"As numbers of those identifying as nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, particularly among children and young people, this paper presents findings from a multi-sited ethnographic project exploring what it means to grow up as non-religious in Britain. This paper will profile the nonreligious children (ages 7-11 years) of our study and explore the different configurations of their (un)belief as well as the ways in which these beliefs are interrelated with particular worldviews and existential cultures. We identify the key beliefs and concerns non-religious children hold and map nonreligion, secularity, spirituality and religion as they are constructed and negotiated across the spaces of both school and family life. Overall, this paper demonstrates the multiple, complex forms nonreligion takes in childhood and the importance of attending to childhood in order to fully appreciate the nature and diversity of being non-religious.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
"Governing Cemeteries: State Responses to the New Diversity in The Netherlands, Norway and France",Rosemarie van den Breemer,VID Specialized University,Norway,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This book compares state responses to Muslims’ and humanists’ burial needs in the Netherlands, Norway and France, providing a striking image of societal accommodation. It shows that policy responses follow distinctive types of logic between the various levels of governance, and, furthermore, that material solutions matter as well. In a departure from this major finding, author Rosemarie van den Breemer argues for a ‘two-pronged strategy’ in the study of state responses to religion and nonreligion, one that oscillates between theory development and everyday empirical analysis. On the conceptual level, her account deals with the discussion of reified state-church models in the ‘religious governance’ literature and with the concept of secularism in the research agenda of ‘the multiple secularisms and secularities.’ On the empirical level, she carefully maps out the previously uncharted institutional domain of cemeteries. Thus, the volume outlines a methodologically more coherent research agenda for the comparative study of religion, nonreligion, secularism and state.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
"The Critical Study of Non-Religion: Discourse, Identification and Locality",Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This book acts as a bridge between the critical study of 'religion' and empirical studies of 'religion in the real world'. Author Chris Cotter presents a concise and up-to-date critical survey of research on non-religion in the UK and beyond, before presenting the results of extensive research in Edinburgh's Southside which blurs the boundary between 'religion' and 'non-religion'. In doing so, Cotter demonstrates that these are dynamic subject positions, and phenomena can occupy both at the same time, or neither, depending on who is doing the positioning, and what issues are at stake. This book details an approach that avoids constructing 'religion' as in some way unique, whilst also fully incorporating 'non-religious' subject positions into religious studies. It provides a rich engagement with a wide variety of theoretical material, rooted in empirical data, which will be essential reading for those interested in critical, sociological and anthropological study of the contemporary non-/religious landscape.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Religious Decline since the Church-State Separation in Sweden,Isabella Kasselstrand,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In 2000, the Church of Sweden was disestablished as a State church. As all citizens were historically members regardless of religious convictions, the Church has predominantly symbolized a cultural heritage in a secularizing society. However, since the church-state tie was severed, there has been a sharp decline in membership, from 83% of the population in 2000 to 56% in 2019. Given that Swedes now make more active choices about their religious affiliation, a reasonable assumption is that those who choose to remain are more pious than the church body was before the disestablishment. Yet, contrary to this hypothesis, findings from ISSP data (1998-2018) suggest that not only the unaffiliated, but also the remaining Church of Sweden adherents, have in fact continued to become less likely to believe in God or a higher power, showing clear trends toward ongoing secularization both within the Church and in the population as a whole.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
In Satan We Trust: The Satanic Temple’s Activism,Mathieu Colin,University of Montreal,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper aims to demonstrate how the Satanic Temple represents a new form of religious expression. They claim to be a Satanist group that belongs to the rationalist branch of contemporary Satanism (Petersen 2009); they are political activists who advocate secularism and separation of church-state; and they consider the Satanic Temple as a religious group that promotes an “atheistic religion” (Greaves 2013). Their purpose is to propose a religious alternative that fights for pluralism and religious freedom with a secularist approach, by challenging the power of organized religions in the public sphere. The provocative and religious approach of the Temple intends to challenge and to balance the power of Christianity in the US. Therefore, this paper will argue that the Satanic Temple is a unique example of the recent politicization of the non-religious minority (Cimino and Smith 2014), in order to counterbalance the presence of religion in the public sphere and its influence on public policies. It is also an original way to explore the link between secularism and power through the negotiation of tensions between the Temple and other religious groups. Moreover, it is an opportunity to study religion as a political expression, since the Satanic Temple states that their political activism is their religion. This paper will examine some of their actions as well as their views on religious freedom and pluralism that result from them.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
How Transnational Debates Inform laïcité in Québec: An Analysis of European Influence in the Crafting of Bill 21,Jennifer A. Selby,Memorial University of Newfoundland,Canada,F,Amélie Barras,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With legal projects beginning in 2010, several Québécois political parties have reinforced a model of religious governance that is decidedly different from the remainder of Canada and shares features with the French model of laïcité. Scholars have considered the impacts of European (e.g., French 2004 and 2011 laws; a Belgian 2011 law) in framing and informing Québécois secularism. Bill 21 is the first to pass into law. Seeking to qualify this transnationalism in relation to 2019’s Bill 21, we ask: which arguments from the francophone transnational sphere resonated most? Which actors (e.g., intellectuals, thinkers and activists) facilitated this circulation? We focus specifically on oral and written parliamentary interventions during the debates prior to Bill 21, and on arguments present in five Québécois newspapers: the Journal de Montréal, La Presse, Le Devoir, Le Soleil and the Montréal Gazette. Our aim is to map the influence of European debates on Bill 21.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Religious Disaffiliated or Religious Indifferent? Morphology of the Unaffiliated in Argentina,Juan Cruz Esquivel,University of Buenos Aires/National Council of Scientific and Technical Research,Argentina,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article aims to characterize the socio-economic and demographic profile of the population without religious affiliation in Argentina, as well as their beliefs, practices and attitudes towards a range of issues related to public and private life. The research was based on the Second National Survey on Religious Beliefs and Attitudes in Argentina, carried out in 2019. The study’s universe was made up of the population of the Argentine Republic aged 18 years or more, living in localities or urban agglomerations with at least 5,000 inhabitants. A total of 2,421 cases were selected through multistage sampling. The analysis of the data reveals that it would be inaccurate to say that the religiously unaffiliated do not convey religious beliefs. Given that those who responded do not belong to any religion but neither defined themselves as agnostics or atheists are the most numerous sub-group and with the highest growth rate within the religiously unaffiliated, it would be unwise to consider this fringe of the Argentine citizenry as a-religious.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Religious Residual: Investigating Variations in Religiosity Among the Unaffiliated,Nadia Beider,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Israel,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The number of religious nones in Western Europe has tripled in the last thirty years. Despite identifying outside organized religion, nones are not uniformly non-religious. In order to ascertain why some nones are more religious than others, this paper examines the impact of prior religious affiliation by comparing the religiosity of disaffiliates and lifelong nones. It draws on data from three waves of the ISSP religion module in four countries - France, Germany, Sweden and the UK. Multivariable regressions demonstrate that disaffiliates are consistently more religious than cradle nones, due to a religious residual from childhood, which helps explain the variance in religiosity among nones. Furthermore, religiosity declines among both groups over time, particularly in Germany, with its higher proportion of second generation lifelong nones. Religiosity among nones is temporary, weakening with each passing generation due to secularization processes, which is only slightly mitigated by countervailing individualization trends.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

The aim of the project is to explore the affective bonds between the presumed secular (Norris & Inglehart, 2011) majorities in Scandinavia, their respective former State churches, and how ideas of a Christian heritage, culture, and national identity interlink in popular imaginings. Building on theoretical work on nominal Christianity and nationalism (Day, 2011), and banal religiosity (Hjarvard, 2008), this project will contribute to knowledge on the relationship between the perception of secularity, religious nostalgia, and nationalism in religiously indifferent, culturally Christian populations.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Complexity and Eclecticism: Exploring the Experiences and Worldviews of the ‘Spiritual But Not Religious’,James Murphy,Canterbury Christ Church University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This study uses Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to investigate the lived experiences of five ‘spiritual but not religious’ (SBNR) individuals in England. This includes an examination of the moral and social dimensions of the individuals’ nonreligious lives and the socio-cultural influences on their beliefs and practices. Semi-structured interviews with each participant were analyzed using an inductive and iterative process that examines both their experiences and how they learned to make sense of themselves and the world. This analysis developes seven themes, which are organized into two superordinate themes: ‘Experiencing Transcendence’ and ‘Constructing a Personal Spirituality’. These participants value their own experiences and intuitions highly, actively working to make sense of the world. They reject dogmatic religious authorities and follow their own moral instincts, seeking to help others and make the world a better place. Their lives are an eclectic and complex fusion of diverse practices, relationships, and existential understandings.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Is the Door Finally Open to a Secular Christianity?,Brendon Neilson,University of Victoria,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Prior to his execution, Dietrich Bonhoeffer corresponded with a friend from his prison cell near the end of WWII. He wondered if the time had come for a religionless Christianity in light of the clear evil the religious version had espoused and enabled. A lineage of theological works in this vein were produced throughout the decades that followed, but with relatively obscure academic acceptance, and little adoption by communities of faith. This paper engages this lineage of secular theologies (with particular attention to Ronald Gregor Smith) in light of Martin Hagglund's This Life, to wonder if perhaps now the door is open to a secular vision of Christian life.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

Semi-directed interviews were conducted with 20 players who were asked about their rituals, as well as their religious/nonreligious backgrounds and present identifications. While most interviewees describe having a religious affiliation, some players present themselves as atheists or agnostics. Our results also show that religion is very present in the world of football, notably through group prayers on game day, and that individual prayer rituals are frequently used during preparation. Most importantly, a common set of values including respect, hard work, selflessness, loyalty, and brotherhood comes across as essential to what you could call the “spirit of football,” which brings together teammates as well as opponents – because they’re “all in this together.”",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

The objective of this study is threefold: to analyze the spiritual and religious needs of populations incarcerated in provincial detention centers; to evaluate programs related to chaplaincy and spiritual care; and to examine the issue of radicalization as it arises. I will present the main results showing that if the rise of spirituality manifests itself, it does so simultaneously with a persistence of inherited religions, or with non-religion. 330 staff and 950 inmates participated in the research (online and paper questionnaires, interviews), providing a surprising understanding of religion, non-religion and spirituality in prison. In view of the results, it is questionable whether the recent adoption of the concept of spirituality to define old pastoral services in public institutions is not missing something, giving the impression that spirituality is something “beyond” religions and nonreligion when it may not be.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Perceptions of Ethnic-Racial and Religious Diversity in Brazil and Argentina and Their Political-Legal Expressions,Paula Montero,University of São Paulo,Brazil,M,Camila Nicácio,University of Minas Gerais,Brazil,F,Juan Marco Vaggione,National University of Córdoba,Argentina,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article aims to understand how dominant perceptions of ethnic-racial diversity, which can be apprehended through official instruments such as census surveys, are connected to religious diversity governance in Brazil and Argentina, countries where Catholicism has had a hegemonic impact. Our hypothesis is that race and ethnic definitions are crucial in the social and legal process of contestations about which popular performances constitute religious practices. In this sense, the normative Catholic-related perspective played an important role in the design of the secular legal-political perspective of religious freedom. To demonstrate this connection we will analyze, comparatively, the constitutional framework historically given to religious and ethnic-racial diversity. We will demonstrate that the way of perceiving and categorizing diversity expresses itself in state responses to control it through state policies. We assume that the differences between the two countries in dealing with religious diversity strains in various ways the relations between freedom and equality regimes, although some parallels in the configurations of inequality are noticeable.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Not Indigenous Enough: The Voices of Indigenous Atheists in Three Canadian Cities,Jonathan S. Simmons,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite an increasing trend towards non-religious identification, limited information is available about nonreligion among Indigenous peoples in North America. To address this gap in the literature, I interviewed 16 Indigenous (i.e., First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) people, most of whom self-identified as atheists, residing in three Canadian cities: Edmonton, Calgary, and Winnipeg. The aim of my research was exploratory in that I wanted to understand how Indigenous people described religion and nonreligion and I wanted to give voice to the diversity of their experiences. My primary finding is that Indigenous atheists experience stigma because they challenge multiple social norms around religion and spirituality in Indigenous communities. This study is the first to explore the unique experiences of Indigenous atheists in Canada and highlights the need to further research minority and marginalized nonreligious populations. Implications for future research are discussed.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
Rethinking Nonreligion in Canadian Law: Looking Beyond Atheism,Cory Steele,University of Ottawa,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Since the 1960s, Canada, like many other Western countries, has experienced a rapid growth in the number of people who identify as having “no religion.” This increase in the nonreligious has prompted various social institutions to reconsider a number of policies to ensure this growing population is afforded full and equal participation in society. The law has been called on by the nonreligious to decide upon the constitutionality of various social practices promoted by the State, including the use of prayer to open municipal town hall meetings, and legislation that has often prohibited access to physician-assisted dying, same-sex marriage, and abortion. Interestingly, however, most cases brought before courts by the nonreligious are done so by atheists. Thus, legal institutions have largely only addressed one type of nonreligion. Given this limited engagement, what, then, are the implications of this for nonreligion? This paper argues that the law imagines most nonreligious individuals as “atheists” and conceptualizes atheism, and therefore nonreligion more generally, as simply lacking a belief in God. Courts ignore the meaningful beliefs, practices, and values that characterize atheism and nonreligion as it is lived.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

This paper provides an overview of the diverse practices that surround legislative prayer across Canada. It then surveys the historical controversies surrounding legislative prayer in Canada, along with the arguments presented for and against this practice. The Saguenay decision applied only to municipalities, and at the time, the court suggested that prayer at higher levels of government could be protected by parliamentary privilege.

We decided to investigate further to determine the number of municipalities operating in violation of Saguenay. We began by surveying to top 50 municipalities (by population) in each province, inspecting agendas and minutes of regular and inaugural sessions. For provinces where prayer was identified in three or more municipalities (Ontario, BC, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta), we expanded our investigation to examine every municipality with a population over 1,000. In addition to detailing the results of this survey, we explore the particular nuance of municipal prayer in each province – for example, in BC the practice is restricted to inaugural meetings, whereas in Manitoba and Ontario, prayers can be found in regular sessions.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

This list of sample prayers was recently revised by the Office of the Clerk to include prayers from a number of religious traditions. To update this list, the Office of the Clerk needed to identify religious and belief groups in BC, select a reasonable number of those groups to include on the list, and identify prayers and reflections that are representative of those traditions. Each of these steps raises practical questions with respect to how bureaucrats can make these decisions, and to more fundamental questions regarding the appropriateness of the decisions made.

Re-Disenchanting Weber: Looking again at “Science as a Vocation”,Donovan Schaefer,University of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Charles Taylor writes that “[e]veryone can agree that one of the big differences between us and our ancestors of 500 years ago is that they lived in an ‘enchanted’ world and we do not.” (“Western Secularity,” 38) But what disenchantment means is a moving target. Critics such as George Levine, Jane Bennett, and Jason Josephson-Storm have argued that the disenchantment narrative is flawed—that even in modern secularity, “we have never been disenchanted.” This paper takes a different tack. Going back to Max Weber’s “Science as a Vocation,” it argues that rather than disenchantment being a “myth,” disenchantment is not what we think it is. For Weber in this essay, disenchantment is not so much the eradication of feeling as it is a rearrangement of feeling and thinking into new affective forms. This calls on us to rethink how disenchantment fits into theories of secularization.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.

From the Census to the Academic Literature: Mapping the Framing of Nonreligion in Brazil,Henrique Fernandes Antunes,Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning,Brazil,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The results of the last censuses have sparked a growing interest in the increase of people who declare themselves "nonreligious" in Brazil, mobilizing various social segments, such as the media, academia, religious institutions, non-governmental organizations, among others, in a climate of uneasiness that seeks to understand the impacts of such growth to Brazilian society. Based on this uneasiness, this presentation intends to take a step back, analyzing the ways in which the category "nonreligion" was developed as a census terminology, being incorporated later into the academic debate, constituting a new analytical object and, at the same time, a new social segment. We intend to demonstrate that the advance of "nonreligion" in Brazil is understood by the academic literature as part of the social dynamics that have altered the configurations of the Brazilian religious field. In this movement, nonreligion is not apprehended as an alternative to religion or its opposite, but as one of the multiple options within the Brazilian religious field.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.
"Images of Place, Secularity and Gentrification: On Urban Religious Belonging in an Inner City Neighbourhood in Oslo",Erik Thorstensen,Work Research Institute,Norway,M,Aina Landsverk Hagen,Work Research Institute,Norway,F,Ingar Brattbakk,Work Research Institute,Norway,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Through extensive fieldwork conducted in an inner city neighbourhood in Oslo, Norway, the authors found that a variation of actors and settings evoked different religious and secular images of place. In what ways is the urban experience shaping or challenging the religious sense of spatial belonging, and why is a secular discourse dominating the scene? In order to obtain such images and sense of place in the context of a recently established area based initiative, we interviewed representatives for the religious communities localized in the neighbourhoods of Tøyen and Grønland. Here we encountered no religiously infused language despite a sizeable spatial religious presence. In the sciences of religion, the view of a separation between the secular and the religious as a social fact and a social norm in modern societies dominates. We argue that there is a privatization of religion (Casanova 1994) within the larger discourse of urban renewal and gentrification. Simultaneously we find the reverse of Taylor’s (2007) proposal of the emptying of religion in social space: namely a filling up of religion in social spaces, that we label ‘urban religious belonging’. This article provides further empirically based knowledge into the connection of religion, secularism and the urban sphere, the difference between belief and representations or discourses, as well as a methodological approach for studying these connections and fractures.",2021,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,10,.,.
