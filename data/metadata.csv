Members of Atheist/Freethought/Secularist organizations in Germany and the United States,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I would like to contribute a paper documenting my current research on organized atheism in Germany and the United States. With my study, I set out to investigate the motives, experiences, and biographies of those who have become more or less active members of primarily politically oriented (rather than philosophical, academic, or congregational) atheist / freethought / secularist organizations. While focusing only on members of this particular type of organization, my aim has been to vary the members' characteristics with regard to their age, gender, duration of membership, degree of activism, and socio-religious background as much as possible. With respect to the latter aspect, I have conducted interviews with members of German IBKA (International League of Non-Religious and Atheists) and BfG (Bavarian Freethought Association) in generally atheistic Berlin, religiously mixed North Rhine Westphalia, and traditionally Catholic Bavaria, as well as with members of local chapters and affiliates of the U.S. organizations American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International in California, Minnesota, and Georgia.

A secular mind,Jonathan A. Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Cognitive anthropologists argue that we can better answer enduring anthropological questions by utilizing the growing insights of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This belief is not wholly unjustified, as cognitive anthropologists have had some success in addressing the long-standing question of why religious beliefs and practices are so widespread in human populations, mostly in reference to universal cognitive biases. This success, however, raises another enduring anthropological question, that of how to best account for ―secularization.‖ If religious beliefs are so well supported by universal cognitive biases, whence secularization and atheism? In this presentation, I will argue that a cognitive approach can help answer one important element of the secularization debate, the question of whether or not particular socio-economic environments cause decreased levels of religious belief and commitment. I will present both qualitative and quantitative data from my fieldwork and survey research among non-theists in Western countries suggesting that particular socio-economic environments do indeed lower levels of religious belief and that this effect occurs through the impact of these environments on our cognitive mechanisms devoted to reasoning about social groups and about what representations to accept from others.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"mind,anthropologist,question,insight,science,belief,anthropologist,success,question,belief,practice,population,reference,bias,success,question,account,belief,bias,secularization,atheism,presentation,approach,element,secularization,debate,question,environment,level,belief,commitment,datum,fieldwork,research,non,theist,country,environment,level,belief,effect,impact,environment,mechanism,group,representation"
Theoretical and methodological resources for breaking open the secular and exploring the boundary between religion and non-religion,Kim Knott,University of Leeds,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The secular condition, secularism and the associated non-religious ideological categories of agnosticism and atheism have particular significance in contemporary Europe. Given that these concepts and their associated fields of belief, practice and organization represent a counter-field of interest for scholars of religion, as well as an increasingly important arena in the politics of religion, we ignore them at our peril. I shall consider the conceptual and categorical relationship between the religious and the secular, the boundary which separates them, and the resources that are available in the study of religion for examining this relationship. In particular, I shall refer to three approaches: historical/conceptual, spatial/discursive, and cognitive/cultural. These are all tools for understanding more about how we see imagine, define, classify and represent religion and its other (whether we call that non-religion or the secular), tools that, once employed, might challenge the categories we use and the anxieties they induce.

Supernatural agency detection in random visual noise,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the cognitive science of religion it has been suggested that belief in supernatural agents is ubiquitous because of its capacity to fit the human cognitive system. Specifically, Barrett (2004) has suggested that a hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD), alongside other cognitive tools such as Theory of Mind, mediates this belief. Due to the hypersensitivity of the agency detection device, it is prone to find agents in the environment, even when none are present. Why some individuals do not believe in supernatural agency despite presumably still having a HADD has, however, previously gone untested. The task set was to detect (1) when the stimulus was a degraded image, and (2) what the image was (free response). Data from these tasks provide information on controlled and automatic dispositional factors at work during agency detection. Preliminary results suggest that there is a significant difference in the types of agency and non-agency detected within the random stimuli. This was across the participant groups, however, and there was no significant difference between the two belief-groups regarding the frequency with which agency was detected. Significant differences between the two participant groups were found, however, when analysing levels of psychoticism, boundaries and empathy, highlighting potential confounding variables that may interfere with the study of agency detection in religious and non-religious participants.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"agency,detection,noise,science,religion,belief,agent,capacity,system,barrett,agency,detection,device,hadd,tool,theory,mind,belief,agency,detection,device,agent,environment,individual,agency,hadd,task,set,stimulus,image,image,response,datum,task,information,factor,work,agency,detection,result,difference,type,agency,agency,stimulus,participant,group,difference,belief,group,frequency,agency,difference,participant,group,level,psychoticism,boundary,empathy,variable,study,agency,detection,participant"
Atheism in post-socialist conditions: The examples of Slovenia and Croatia,Marjan Smrke,University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the majority of countries in Western Europe have become more secular in recent times, most post-socialist countries have been undergoing a process of desecularization. The disintegration of the socialist regime in Yugoslavia, which functioned as a sort of secular civil religion, took place in a period of escalating intranational tensions, conflicts, and ethno-religious mythologies. Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina, the nations most involved in the military conflicts from 1991 to 1995, have undergone a marked desecularization on the societal, organizational, and individual levels. From some perspectives, it might appear that Slovenia is an exception to this trend, as its transition to independence did not trigger a desecularization factor or what Steve Bruce termed ―cultural defence‖. But nevertheless we can speak in all of these cases of the essentially altered social position of atheism. If it was privileged before, it is now affected by strengthened and emboldened church ideologies. We observe in both Slovenia and Croatia the re-emergence of certain traditional attitudes toward atheism, which Colin Cambell, in his Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, called Victorian prejudices (Cambell, 1974). For this reason, I have undertaken in recent years the empirical testing of the following theses that have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral, and; 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Church about educated Slovenians and Croatians are unsubstantiated. Especially in Slovenia, both ―conviced atheists‖ and ―natural atheists‖ show (according to their own statements) above-average happiness, above-average reflection on life, above-average moral rigour and are less distanced from various social minorities. The reasons for such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia and Croatia on the other. The dialectic relationship between these two phenomena justifies (once again) the conclusion that the sociology of religion must incorporate the sociology of non-religiosity/irreligion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"atheism,condition,example,slovenia,croatia,majority,country,europe,time,country,process,disintegration,regime,yugoslavia,sort,religion,place,period,tension,conflict,mythology,croatia,serbia,bosnia,herzegovina,nation,conflict,level,perspective,slovenia,exception,trend,transition,independence,factor,steve,bruce,―cultural,defence‖.,case,position,atheism,church,ideology,slovenia,croatia,emergence,attitude,atheism,colin,cambell,sociology,irreligion,prejudice,cambell,reason,year,testing,representative,church,atheist,atheist,life,atheist,atheist,solidarity,minority,basis,datum,issp,evs,wvs,statement,church,slovenian,croatian,slovenia,―conviced,atheists‖,―natural,atheists‖,statement,happiness,reflection,life,average,rigour,minority,reason,finding,analysis,ethos,value,habitus,catholicism,hand,ideology,slovenia,croatia,dialectic,relationship,phenomenon,conclusion,sociology,religion,sociology,irreligion"
Belief in science and in the “Da Vinci Code”: Measuring naturalistic beliefs and its cognitive correlates,Miguel Farias,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper describes the development of a scale of naturalistic beliefs by the author of the paper, in collaboration with philosophers Guy Kahane and Nick Shackle, and the historian of science John Hedley Brooke. Preliminary validation of the scale was carried out with a sample of religious and atheist students (N = 130), that also filled in a number of other measures, including belief in ideas put forward in the best-selling ―Da Vinci Code‖ novel, knowledge of the Bible, and standardised cognitive and personality scales. I will present and discuss the newly developed scale on naturalistic beliefs as a way of tapping into contemporary atheists' ideas and attitudes, particularly related to the value attributed to science in understanding the world.

Dimensions and types of non-religiosity: Scale development in progress,Nicholas Gibson,University of Cambridge,England,M,Claire White,University of Oxford,England,F,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"We are unaware of any scale or instrument that can be used to distinguish among types of non-religious individuals. Although various labels exist to describe non-religious and secular positions (such as atheist or agnostic), these are often misunderstood or misapplied by laypersons. Even where they are correctly used it is clear that—for example—atheists differ in their emotional responses to religion, their intellectual interest in religion, and their behavioural repertoire with regard to religious individuals and institutions. Rather than attempting to generate a typology from philosophical grounds we see merit in allowing a typology to emerge empirically, thus tapping nonreligiosity as it is lived. This paper will present data from a 24-item scale intended to capture dimensions of non-religiosity within a sample of 131 British adult subjects selfdescribing as atheists or agnostics.

"Christo-secular ambivalence in British security policy, 2001-2009",Stacey Gutkowski,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although secularism has recently become a site of analysis for international politics, it has as yet received little theoretical elaboration in the area of security studies. A new research programme is needed to further this end, one that is not merely a secondary addendum to the existing one on religion and security. This paper suggests some directions for that research agenda, that turns to examine how trajectories of secularization and non-religion in Britain impacted on security policy towards radical Islam between 2001-2009.

The challenge of popular religion to atheism: a socio-cognitive approach,Steven Sutcliffe,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a recent British opinion poll, 64% (n=1000) believe that ‗some people have powers that cannot be explained by science', 49% believe in ghosts, and 41% believe in communication with the dead. Earlier Gorer (1955), in a survey conducted in an English newspaper, found equally robust levels of belief in ghosts, reincarnation and horoscopes. The ‗new age' or ‗holistic' milieu is similarly fecund (Sutcliffe 2003, Heelas and Woodhead 2005). I argue that such qualitative evidence in the UK (for example) suggests that – despite apparent triumphs of secular modernity - religious belief and practice is alive and well in its popular, ‗theologically incorrect' (Barrett 1999/Slone 2004) expressions. These expressions support more complex, synthetic and/or discursive forms of ‗religion', making the articulation of ‗religion' in ordinary, everyday life settings appear unremarkable and ‗natural'. On this evidence, modernity and popular religion are not mutually exclusive, secularization has in-built limitations, and atheism – defined as predicating social identity on denial of god(s) - is likely to remain a pursuit of intellectual minorities. I argue that ‗folk' narratives and models are a better guide to what ‗religion' is like at the point of production than sophisticated and abstracted reflections produced by specially trained elites (whether religious or secular). They also point to the persistence and longevity of ‗religion' insofar as cognitive representations generated below the level of conscious awareness instinctively reinforce socially constructed discourses. The elementary forms of ‗religion' are thus co-produced by cognitive processes in human brains operating in synchronization with sociological forces of order and legitimation. Atheism is likely to find this popular double act hard to breach.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"challenge,religion,atheism,approach,opinion,poll,n=1000,‗some,people,power,science,ghost,communication,gorer,survey,newspaper,level,belief,ghost,reincarnation,horoscope,‗new,age,‗holistic,milieu,sutcliffe,heelas,woodhead,evidence,example,triumph,modernity,belief,practice,barrett,slone,expression,expression,form,‗religion,articulation,‗religion,life,setting,evidence,modernity,religion,secularization,limitation,atheism,identity,denial,god(s,pursuit,minority,narrative,model,guide,‗religion,point,production,reflection,elite,persistence,longevity,‗religion,representation,level,awareness,discourse,form,‗religion,process,brain,synchronization,force,order,legitimation,atheism,act"
A British secular–religious cleavage?,Stratos Patrikios,University of Strathclyde,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The growing visibility of secular commentators and organisations in Britain is often regarded as evidence of a cultural conflict between ‗the Secular' and 'the Religious'. Two key assumptions underlie this popular account: that there is growing disagreement between the two groups, and that each group is a homogenous actor that can be mobilised against the other. But are these assumptions supported in reality? For instance, can we meaningfully speak of a 'secular' camp on cultural issues? The paper answers these questions by examining whether the controversy we see in the media reflects a divide at the mass level. The analysis uses survey data to model distributional measures of public opinion over time (1983-2007). Two types of social attitudes are examined: positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relations. Results identify a widening gap between the non religious and the religious (esp. Anglicans) regarding attitudes towards homosexual relations. This widening gap is a function of the differential rate of liberalisation that has affected both groups. However, if the gap is to be consequential for social and political developments, each competing group should be growing increasingly homogenous. Findings suggest that there is no such trend in the internal coherence of the two groups.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"cleavage,visibility,commentator,organisation,britain,evidence,conflict,assumption,account,disagreement,group,group,actor,assumption,reality,instance,camp,issue,paper,question,controversy,medium,divide,level,analysis,survey,datum,measure,opinion,time,type,attitude,position,sex,relation,result,gap,anglican,attitude,relation,gap,function,rate,liberalisation,group,gap,development,group,finding,trend,coherence,group"
"The good atheistic Samaritan: Intrinsic, extrinsic and quest atheism and its relationship with prosocial behaviour",Sven Oelsner,University of Jena,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary psychological research concerning the relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour shows an ambiguous picture. Some researchers found a correlation between religiousness and helping behaviour (Bernt, 1989; Hansen, Vandenberg, & Patterson, 1995; Sappington & Baker, 1995) where others did not (Darley & Batson, 1973; Smith, Wheeler, & Diener, 1975; Sundeen & Raskoff, 1995). In studies documenting positive effects religiousness was frequently investigated with qualitative measures such as the intrinsic, extrinsic and quest religiosity scales proposed by Batson (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991). These scales are based on underlying constructs covering social activities, philosophical thinking, ritualistic behaviour and worldview scepticism practiced by atheists and theists alike. However, terms specifically associated with Christianity (e.g. church, prayer, bible) increase the item difficulty for atheists and generate variance in the theistic sample only. The study to be presented investigated the question whether religiosity scales measure theistic/ supernatural beliefs or rather social, cultural and philosophical activities. The results indicate that the supposed relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour is not based on theistic religiosity (i.e. belief in the existence of supernatural beings) but rather on sociocultural attitudes shared by theists and atheists.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.,"samaritan,quest,atheism,relationship,behaviour,research,relationship,religiousness,behaviour,picture,researcher,correlation,religiousness,behaviour,bernt,hansen,vandenberg,patterson,sappington,baker,darley,batson,smith,wheeler,diener,sundeen,raskoff,study,effect,religiousness,measure,quest,religiosity,scale,batson,batson,scale,construct,activity,thinking,behaviour,worldview,scepticism,atheist,theist,term,christianity,e.g.,church,prayer,bible,item,difficulty,atheist,variance,sample,study,question,religiosity,scale,belief,activity,result,relationship,religiousness,behaviour,religiosity,i.e.,belief,existence,being,attitude,theist,atheist"
Methodological challenges in understanding different modes and locations of irreligiosity,Teemu Taira,University of Leeds,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper demonstrates how to make use of existing survey data on religion when studying Atheism and irreligiosity. I shall suggest that it is useful to make a distinction between Atheism (as an identity tag) and general irreligiosity (for example indifference). This is especially so, because the current debate on New Atheism is dividing the irreligious: some identify themselves as atheists while others refuse to do so. Furthermore, it is helpful to study the phenomenon by not simply looking at beliefs but also identification, attitudes, participation, private practice and membership (including reflections on future membership). The importance of these distinctions lies in an attempt to construct a coherent picture of the varying modes and locations of Atheism and irreligiosity. It also may change the way the issue is dealt with more generally, because in public discourse these distinctions are often neglected. Although my research is focused on public discourse in Britain and Finland, in this example I will focus upon Finnish society. I shall suggest, however, that the methodological strategies can be applied to all societies where Western-style discourse on religion exists. Instead of simply attempting to explain the Finnish situation by referring to meaningful sociological variables such as education, gender, class, age and region, I shall combine the survey data – World Values Survey, Church Monitor and Gallup Ecclesiastica (1995–2005) – with systematically collected newspaper material to offer an interpretation of the Finnish situation. Two observations will be made: firstly, Finnish people are belonging (to religious organisations because of others) but not practising (themselves); secondly, they are rather irreligious (indifferent, non-religious) but not self-identifying Atheists.

The 'return of religion' and the return of the criticism of religion: The 'New Atheism' in recent German and American culture,Thomas Zenk,Free University of Berlin,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Criticism of religion can be found throughout the ages, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. It appears that history of religions itself can be interpreted as continued criticisms of one religion against another (e.g. Christianity as criticism of Judaism and Mediterranean pagan polytheism, Buddhism as criticism of Hinduism and so on) or within one religion (phenomena such as reform movements, fundamentalism etc.). Both, in intra-religious as well as inter-religious criticisms the frame of religion is not transcended. An explicit non-religious criticism of religion, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the history. It can be traced back to the European Age of Enlightenment. Nowadays, atheistic or even anti-religious voices have returned and the books by the so-called 'New atheists' (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett) are all bestsellers and were widely and vividly discussed. Both, the theses and arguments of the 'New atheists' as well as their public reception are examined in the course of a research project at the Free University of Berlin. Our project aims to analyze these two aspects in a historical comparison of the situation in Europe and the United States. By means of a discourse analysis, we hope to gain insights about the relations between what is called ―the return of religion‖ (Riesebrodt) and the return of the criticism of religion.

As a literary scholar I meanly analyze fiction and to some extent film, but I also catch try to catch a glimpse of apocalyptic prophecy in science. In a postmodern context the concept of the end has changed fundamentally.

(Derrida 1983). Some key questions concerning the “secularized apocalypse” are: In a secularized age thinking the end is not any more a practice restricted to religion. Scientific models dominate our picture of the end of the world. Wars, ecological disasters, and cosmic catastrophes have the power to destroy the world as we know it. In this context apocalypse becomes an umbrella term for many phenomena which all have in common a complete or near complete destruction of the world. In a biblical sense from this point a renewal of the world would happen. But is this the case in a secularized apocalypse?

In the preceding decades there were atheistic sub-cultures such as radical politics or university education which allowed some to realise their unbelief, yet others rejected religion with little apparent external influence.

It is thus focusing on religion and secularism at a cultural crossroads, where the religious and the secular are at an intersection or boundary, embedded in each other, but where politics of meaning are fraught and contested (Knott 2005).

Disenchanting India qualifies this representation through an analysis of the contemporary Indian rationalist organisations (those that affirm the values and attitudes of atheism, humanism or free-thinking).To understand the genesis of organised rationalism in India the book addresses the rationalists’ emphasis on maintaining links to atheism and materialism in ancient India and outlines their strong ties to the intellectual currents of modern European history. At the heart of Disenchanting India lies an ethnography of the organisation “Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti” (Organisation for the Eradication of Superstition) based in Maharashtra. This account describes the organization’s efforts to promote a scientific temper and combat the beliefs and practices it regards as superstitious. It also includes an analysis of rationalism in the day to day lives of its members and in relation to the organization’s controversial position within Indian society.The book outlines the distinguishing characteristics of this organisation through a depiction of the rationalists’ specific “mode of unbelief” in comparison to “modes of religiosity”. Alongside a critical engagement with the work of Max Weber and Charles Taylor, the theoretical discussion of modes of unbelief further provides an original basis for comparative studies of similar movements in a trans-cultural perspective.

Instead, its distribution can be explained by „human-nature‟ (aspects of our evolved psychological make-up) in interaction with the socio-cultural contexts in which we live. Lanman guides us through this hypothesis. There is, he said, a large body of evidence against the idea that humans come to our understandings solely through a process of rational reflection. Instead, we see patterns in random occurrences; we often fall prey to our own confirmation bias, tending to look for evidence to confirm our views and rarely looking for evidence to disprove it. Rather, „rationality‟ is usually used to describe a normative vision of how we should think a view prevalent in contemporary Atheist and Humanist discourse. Yet rationalism fails as a general explanation for nonreligious normative stances, instead we need to look to socio-cultural. Lanman‟s ultimate view is that neither belief or non-belief are natural; we need to start from a view that our behaviour is mostly unconscious and our brains are wired to numerous specialisms which can be affected without damaging the overall intelligence or other specialist functions.",2011,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.,"atheism,origin,thought,lanman,atheism,religion,boyer‟s,account,byproduct,distribution,human,nature‟,aspect,interaction,context,lanman,hypothesis,body,evidence,idea,human,understanding,process,reflection,pattern,occurrence,prey,confirmation,bias,evidence,view,evidence,rationality‟,vision,view,atheist,discourse,rationalism,explanation,stance,socio,view,belief,belief,view,behaviour,brain,specialism,intelligence,specialist,function"

Secularity is then a term encompassing the religious-secular binary and built upon discourses and practices, which deploy this distinction.

Defining 'Atheism’: A Modest Proposal,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lois Lee’s draft glossary provides us which much – and valuable – food for thought. However with one definition, at least, I find myself in disagreement: Atheism – a conscious or unconsious lack of commitment to God(s) (2011: 2) Commitment strikes me as a problematic and ambiguous category. Is this a lack of intellectual commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of commitment to (the idea that there exists [a]) God(s)’ ? Or a lack of what one might term an existential commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of (personal, devoted, trusting?) commitment to God(s)’? The former might imply the latter, but the same is not true vice versa. It can be argued that while a great many Britons have at least some kind of intellectual commitment to the idea of God existing (even if this commitment extends only to ticking the requisite box on sociologists’ surveys), comparatively few have the kind of existential commitment to God(s), traditionally expressed through regular prayer, attendance at religious services, etc. This ambiguity could, of course, be clarified fairly satisfactorily. However, I believe a far better and usable definition of 'atheism’ – one already in scholarly use – can be located in the category not of 'commitment’, but of 'belief’. What I want to do in this short paper, then, is simply to outline what I believe to be a fairly uncontroversial definition of atheism already in scholarly use: 'a lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods’. While I will be presenting a case for the utility of this definition, I do not intend to do so in any exhaustive, defeat-all-comers way.

Cross-national data relating to social, political, economic and cultural aspects of life were tested for correlation with religiosity/secularity. In contrast to the most widely accepted general account of secularity, the Existential Security Framework (ESF; Norris & Inglehart, 2004), secularity was not most highly related to material security, though these were highly related. Rather, secularity was most strongly related to the degree of formal education attained. Material security explained no significant variance beyond education.

Anti-Atheist Bias in the United States: Testing Two Critical Assumptions,Lawton K.

However, much of this scholarship relies on two critical and largely unaddressed assumptions: (a) that when people report negative attitudes toward atheists, they do so because they are reacting specifically to their lack of belief in God; and (b) that survey questions asking about attitudes toward atheists as a group yield reliable information about biases against individual atheist targets. To test these assumptions, an online survey asked a probability-based random sample of American adults (N = 618) to evaluate a fellow research participant (“Jordan”). Jordan garnered significantly more negative evaluations when identified as an atheist than when described as religious or when religiosity was not mentioned. This effect did not differ as a function of labeling (“atheist” versus “no belief in God”), or the amount of individuating information provided about Jordan. These data suggest that both assumptions are tenable: nonbelief—rather than extraneous connotations of the word “atheist”—seems to underlie the effect, and participants exhibited a marked bias even when confronted with an otherwise attractive individual.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.,"bias,state,assumption,decade,opinion,polling,investigation,prejudice,state,scholarship,assumption,people,attitude,atheist,lack,belief,god,survey,question,attitude,atheist,group,information,bias,target,assumption,survey,probability,sample,adult,research,participant,jordan,jordan,evaluation,atheist,religiosity,effect,function,labeling,belief,god,information,jordan,datum,assumption,nonbelief,connotation,word,atheist”—seem,effect,participant,bias,individual"

In a basic way, this has to do with humanists’ commitment to secularism—the differentiation of church and state. In more complex ways, though, it also has to do with an effort to move “beyond” Christianity—to encourage a world in which reason takes the place of revelation—while often, at the same time, recognizing what’s worth saving and even fostering from the legacies of faith.

In addition, those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religious preference as adults. Despite their growing numbers, individuals raised with no religion have received little attention from scholars. The adult religious preferences of these individuals provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test theories of religion and social change. Using General Social Survey data, I examine the adult religious preferences and beliefs of individuals raised with no religion. I provide evidence of a shift in socialization and social influences experienced by those who report growing up with no religion. Compared with earlier cohorts raised with no religion, more recent cohorts have had more secular upbringings and tend to be more secular, liberal, and wary of organized religion as adults. They are also more likely to have a religiously unaffiliated spouse, if they marry at all.

"Functionally Secular / Substantively Nonreligious: Scottish Students, their Secular Sacreds, the Sacred Secular",Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The academic study of religion and related categories is populated with reified, mutually constitutive, and superficially synonymous dichotomies – religion/secular, sacred/profane, sacred/secular, religion/nonreligion – yet each serves a distinct, contextually dependent purpose. In this presentation I shall utilise a case study amongst notionally ‘nonreligious’ undergraduate students, in combination with a discussion of these dichotomies, to problematise the complex relationship between nonreligion and the secular. When asked about their beliefs and ‘religious’ identities, many of these students were substantively nonreligious (utilising Lois Lee’s understanding of nonreligion as defined primarily by the way it differs from religion). This nonreligiosity manifested itself in divers ways, dependent upon idiosyncratic interpretations of ‘religion’, and always linked to particular ‘secular sacreds’, which corresponded to five distinct-yet-overlapping nonreligious types. Individual narratives exemplify pragmatic negotiation of nonreligious identities, ‘fluctuation’ in nonreligious beliefs, and the rhetorical creation of religious ‘others’ against which substantive nonreligiosity was  constructed. In terms of salience and practice, many of these students appeared functionally secular i.e. ‘being nonreligious’ was generally unimportant and had little impact upon day-to-day life. However, the interaction of religion with personal sacreds precipitated the recognition and reaffirmation of subjective nonreligiosity. In many cases, the sacred in question was the ‘secular’ itself, which was profaned by the incursion of religion into individual narratives. This overview of the complex dynamics between these terms provides empirical clarification of the relationship between nonreligion and the secular, and demonstrates that nonreligion is a substantive phenomenon in its own right and, as such, an important component of secular society.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.,"student,sacred,study,religion,category,dichotomy,religion,religion,nonreligion,purpose,presentation,case,study,student,combination,discussion,dichotomy,relationship,nonreligion,belief,identity,student,lois,lee,understanding,nonreligion,way,religion,nonreligiosity,diver,way,interpretation,religion,sacred,type,narrative,negotiation,identity,fluctuation,belief,creation,nonreligiosity,term,salience,practice,student,i.e.,impact,day,day,life,interaction,religion,sacred,recognition,reaffirmation,nonreligiosity,case,question,incursion,religion,narrative,overview,dynamic,term,clarification,relationship,nonreligion,nonreligion,phenomenon,right,component,society"
Questioning the invisibility of non-religion in the contemporary workplace: a process of accommodation?,Mark Read,Goldsmiths College,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper is based upon an interim analysis of a PhD study into the contemporary workplace as seen through the eyes of twenty Quaker interviewees. It questions whether ‘religion’ or ‘nonreligion’ descriptors can be meaningfully applied to modern work organisations. This analysis of the research data is based upon viewing organisations as processual, rather than fixed and structured, entities. Organisations are understood as a confluence of individual, subjective, meaning-making and processes of identity accommodation. (Parker, 2008) Taking the view that subjective identities are fundamentally grounded beyond the organisational form, and articulated at the point of multi-various decision-making within the job role, analysis of the data suggests that the interviewees’ complex motivations remain largely invisible in organisational terms. The interviewees can be regarded as engaging in private articulations of multi-faceted personal beliefs within a locus of public discourse. Within this discourse, Quaker belief is a singular, variously significant aspect of the interviewees’ subjective identity. However, engagement with the requirements of the work role, and contestation of organisational norms in the particular, reveal a more complex articulation of the subjective self that undermines a religious/non-religious binary definition. The paper concludes that individuals in modern, technical-rational organisations (Bauman, 1989) bring a multi-faceted subjectivity to their work which cannot be recognised readily within formal organisational discourses. It suggests finally that subjective identities are organisationally significant, and through their religious/non-religious invisibility, have the potential to shape, unrecognised and fundamentally, the identity of the collective whole.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.,"invisibility,religion,workplace,process,accommodation,paper,analysis,phd,study,workplace,eye,quaker,interviewee,religion,nonreligion,descriptor,work,organisation,analysis,research,data,organisation,entity,organisation,confluence,meaning,making,process,identity,accommodation,parker,view,identity,form,point,decision,making,job,role,analysis,datum,interviewee,motivation,term,interviewee,articulation,belief,locus,discourse,discourse,quaker,belief,aspect,interviewee,identity,engagement,requirement,work,role,contestation,norm,articulation,self,definition,paper,individual,organisation,bauman,subjectivity,work,discourse,identity,invisibility,potential,identity"
The Rise of the People of No Religion,Callum Brown,Dundee University,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the 1950s during her teenage years in England, a woman later recalled, she proclaimed in the school playground her non-belief in God, and for her breach of childhood rules was taunted by her classmates and called a heathen. The 1950s was a decade when there were varying degrees of difficulty almost everywhere in the western world for somebody to proclaim oneself as an atheist. It was especially difficult for a woman, upon whom high expectations were placed for setting a moral and religious standard which would lead, ultimately, to providing the headship, as mother and wife, for the respectability and proper Christian upbringing of a family. In the sixty years since, there has been a remarkable change. The new-found freedom of the individual to proclaim an absence of religious belief and practice has been one of the greatest cultural changes which mark out our modern times. The extent to which the people of the West have become free from religion varies between nations and even within nations, sometimes enormously. But the trend is nonetheless widespread and very marked. Susan Budd ended her history of unbelief in England at 1960, at the very point when no-religionism started to explode in western culture. It is time to take the story forward, and to reflect on this massive alteration, and to transform the way we consider no religion – from consideration of the minorities who have no faith, to analysis of the development of those who form the majorities in some nations of the early twenty-first century. In 2005, 52 % of Europeans said they believed in God; but, as we shall see, even before 2000 a majority in some nations did not adhere to a religion. This article explores the social history of the rise of the people of no religion in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, and the United States with additional evidence from Australia and New Zealand, mainly covering the period from 1950 to 2010 but with some additional review of available evidence stretching back to 1900. After reflecting on the state of existing knowledge in the field, it will explore problems of definition. Using statistics, it will then make a quantitative evaluation of the patterns of growth in the numbers of no-religionists in the above countries, and then inquire more deeply into some demographic patterns observable from the data.

Multiple Secularities: Toward a Cultural Sociology of Secular-Religious Distinctions,Monika Wohlrab-Sahr,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For more than two decades sociological debates over religion and secularization have been characterized by a confrontation between (often American) critics and (mostly European) defenders of secularization theories. At the same time, there was a remarkable rise in public debates about the role of secularism in political regimes and in national as well as civilizational frameworks. Against this backdrop this paper presents the conceptual framework of “multiple secularities” with a view to refocusing sociological research on religion and secularity. We will demonstrate that it can stimulate new ways of theorizing the relationship of religion and secularity in a variety of modern environments. Arguing for a reformulation of this relationship within the framework of cultural sociology, we conceptualize “secularity” in terms of the cultural meanings underlying the differentiation between religion and non-religious spheres. Building on Max Weber we distinguish four basic ideal-types of secularity that are related to specific reference problems and associated with specific guiding ideas.

Gordon Lynch in his recent book The Sacred in the Modern World develops a neo-Durkheimian frame and shows how we identify with multiple sacred forms in late modern society. He rejects a distinction between religious and secular sacreds as meaningless. The point is well taken that the religious and secular do not constitute a true binary. Nonetheless, in this paper, Kim Knott's concept of the secular sacred is taken as analytically productive in the study of non-religious identities. The secular-religious distinction continues to have social force. As outlined in a recent chapter written with David Martin, the secular and religious are mutually constitutive, and the religious and non-religious may be taken to be in a similar dynamic relationship.

After all, a theist is likely to consent that a belief in God is meaningful, perhaps even necessary or rational, while an atheist will probably take a belief in God to be unnecessary, a human construct, perhaps even confusing, undesirable or irrational. In addition, both theists and atheists may be divided on the question of how to demarcate a believer in God from a non-believer in God. Is God something that does or does not exist, which would mean that the theist and the atheist disagree on a belief in God’s existence? (I will call this demarcation strategy the ‘God-existence’ strategy) Or is a belief in God more like a relation or attitude towards certain experiences or elements of human nature, like moral or aesthetic elements of life, which theists would identify with God, while atheists don’t? (I will call this the ‘God-experience’ strategy) And there are other possibilities. In this paper, I argue that clear demarcation strategies are in themselves political tactics and involve the danger of Othering, in a way much like Simone de Beauvoir discusses in The Second Sex. I will use the strategies I just mentioned, the ‘God-existence’ strategy and the ‘God-experience’ strategy, as examples.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.,"othering,theist,dialectic,answer,question,atheist,god,god,meaning,hair,god,theist,atheist,strategy,answer,theist,belief,god,atheist,belief,god,construct,addition,theist,atheist,question,believer,god,believer,god,god,theist,belief,god,existence,demarcation,strategy,god,existence,strategy,belief,god,relation,attitude,experience,element,nature,element,life,theist,god,atheist,god,experience,strategy,possibility,paper,demarcation,strategy,tactic,danger,way,simone,beauvoir,discusse,sex,strategy,god,existence,strategy,god,experience,strategy,example"
Theoretical and Empirical Problems in the Study of Non-Religion,Christel Manning,Sacred Heart University,Connecticut,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper draws on a survey of the literature, as well as original research on non-religious parents, to argue that a major theoretical problem in the study of non-religion is the absence of a substantive definition for this category. 'Non-religion' defines people in terms of what they do not have, implying that they are somehow lacking; and this kind of definition often leads to prejudicial analysis, especially where the characteristics of the majority population determine the categories by which everybody is measured. The term 'non-religion' also obscures the amazing diversity of worldviews within this category, standing in sharp contrast with the way scholars study religion which is  differentiated into tens sometimes hundreds of denominational categories. The paper then shows how the definitional challenge is driven in part by empirical problems:  that scholars often select measures of non-religion for practical reasons (the data is available and accessible), rather than sound theoretical ones; and that measures of non-religion often reflect what the scholar and funding agencies are interested in (e.g., whether the non-religious can be brought back into the fold). While there is much to learn about non-religion from these studies despite empirical problems, the theoretical fuzziness of non-religion continues to distort our understanding of it. The author concludes by proposing the parameters of a framework to develop a more substantive definition of non-religion.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.

In reality, a lot of the work that NS researchers undertake relates and refers to atheism and/or atheist cultures. But, in developing the network, we were conscious that we were situating this broader project not alongside and in relation to research into theism so much as alongside and in relation to a broader programme of research associated with the term ‘religion’. There are, after all, myriad ways of being nonreligious and multiple forms of secularity. What is more, atheism is not always a significant component of either experience, if it is a component at all. There are several possible reasons why ‘atheism’ might have become, by comparison, such a dominant identifier of nonreligiosity: An extension of the Protestant-centric emphasis on belief over practice? An expression of Cartesian dualism, with its emphasis on the mind as distinct from, and more important than, the body? But NS researchers are interested in other things too. We are interested in the nonreligious traditions that are driven by a sense of distance or otherness not from theism but from religious rituals, symbolic representations and communities. We are interested in why and when people – theist, atheist or otherwise – identify themselves as ‘atheist’, ‘nonreligious’, ‘not religious’, ‘secular’ or ‘agnostic’. We are interested in how people engage with nonreligious communities like many contemporary Humanist organisations and atheist groups. And we are interested in very much more besides.","bunch,atheist,introduction,nsrn,post,nsrn,director,founder,lois,lee,work,nsrn,vision,blog,experience,mis,conflation,nonreligion,secularity,research,atheism,advocacy,reference,nonreligion,secularity,mention,atheism,reality,lot,work,researcher,atheism,culture,network,project,relation,theism,relation,programme,research,term,religion,way,form,secularity,atheism,component,experience,component,reason,atheism,comparison,identifier,nonreligiosity,extension,centric,emphasis,belief,practice,expression,dualism,emphasis,mind,body,researcher,thing,tradition,sense,distance,otherness,theism,ritual,representation,community,people,theist,people,community,organisation,group"

Ethnographies of Value in a not so Secular Age, Bender and Taves state that ‘Religion, Secularism and Spirituality become markers of value, as much or more so than they are containers of distinct kinds of actions or ideas. Positively, these terms may mark things, ideas and practices as self-evidently meaningful or link them with “higher”, more expansive aims. Negatively…they are marked as over-valued or wrongly linked to higher aims’ (2012: 10). The assembly implores us to Live better, Help Often and Wonder more.  Wonder is a value in these terms. The cosmologies of religion are negatively marked – it is the wrong answer to the question of the out there: it does not explain, it cannot be proved.

The correlations between ‘atheist’ and ‘American Atheists’ have varied pretty substantially from year-to-year. That searches for the two terms are correlated meets one criteria of causality, but the other two remain to be established.  Temporal causality must also be established.  In no year was one variable’s lagged values a significant predictor of the other variable.  In other words, causality cannot be statistically determined between whether searches for ‘American Atheists’ cause searches for ‘atheists’ or vice versa. My inability to determine causality does not mean there is no causal relationship between American Atheist activism and interest in atheism.  From a logical and theoretical standpoint, it would make sense that there might be some causal relationship. But, as it stands, causality cannot be determined. Additionally, it is possible that other events influence both search terms.","movement,activism,interest,atheism,activity,atheist,interest,atheism,blog,post,ryan,cragun,analysis,correlation,activity,google,search,term,atheist,analysis,google,trend,datum,david,silverman,president,atheist,atheist,interest,atheism,silverman,peak,search,term,atheist,google,search,engine,tool,disposal,silverman,analysis,datum,insight,causality,correlation,atheist,year,year,term,criterion,causality,causality,year,variable,value,predictor,variable,word,causality,search,atheist,search,atheist,inability,causality,relationship,activism,interest,atheism,standpoint,sense,relationship,causality,event,search,term"
Educating ‘Young Nones’ part 1: Young People of No Religion and Religious Education,Simeon Wallis,University of Warwick,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the first of a two part series reflecting on his research among school-aged ‘young nones’ in Britain, Simeon Wallis discusses the emphasis on propositional beliefs within religious education, and the debate around the inclusion of secular philosophies in RE.",2013,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"‘I’m not religious, so why should I study religion?’ This was a remark that I heard often during my time as a teacher of religious education (RE) in secondary schools in England. Encounters with students who described themselves as ‘not religious’ led me to ask questions about the inclusion of secular philosophies within RE, and to undertake ESRC-funded doctoral research on the lives of young people of ‘no religion’. Despite the increasing amount of academic research on nonreligion (Lee and Bullivant 2010), much empirical research has focused on adults. Even the Young Atheist Research Project was mostly concerned with older teenagers and young adults who self-identified as ‘atheists, freethinkers, humanists, secularists or sceptics’. We therefore have very little understanding of the ‘silent majority’ who participate in, and are affected by, RE – and around whom this education is being designed. My own research, focusing specifically on younger adolescents attending secondary schools in England who all report having ‘no religion’, will contribute to this lacuna. By offering insights into the lives of these ‘young nones’, it will complement European-wide studies of young people’s perspectives on religion and religious education, such as those carried out by Knauth et al. (2008) as part of the REDCo project. It will also contribute to our understanding of the nature of nonreligion as an aspect of human life and society, investigating the extent to which young people have beliefs, identities and material expressions that can meaningfully be described as ‘nonreligious’. Questions surrounding nonreligion and young people are broad and pressing, and should not be forgotten within the emerging field of nonreligion and secularity studies.","none,people,religion,education,series,research,school,none,britain,simeon,wallis,emphasis,belief,education,debate,inclusion,philosophy,religion,remark,time,teacher,education,school,england,student,question,inclusion,philosophy,esrc,research,life,people,religion,research,nonreligion,lee,research,adult,research,project,teenager,adult,self,atheist,freethinker,humanist,secularist,sceptic,understanding,majority,education,research,adolescent,school,england,religion,lacuna,insight,life,none,study,people,perspective,religion,education,knauth,project,understanding,nature,nonreligion,aspect,life,society,extent,people,belief,identity,material,expression,question,nonreligion,people,field,nonreligion,secularity,study"

For individuals in the field who have religious beliefs, it is often the case that those beliefs do not come to the forefront of their work. As for the study of atheism specifically, it fits well into Religious Studies because atheists are often engaged with discourse on or about religion; atheism, at the very least, is a reaction to, or negation of, theism.  In the last few years, likely attributable to media and public interest in so-called New Atheism (and, arguably, a New Atheist backlash), atheism has increasingly been studied in Religious Studies. The study of atheism seems to have become normalized within Religious Studies, but that does not mean studying atheism in Religious Studies is not without its concerns.  Care must be given, for example, not to conflate contemporary organized atheism with being a new or pseudo-religion just because it addresses religion and occasionally offers alternatives to concepts or practices that have long been considered the domain of religion.  It is also important to keep in mind that methods and theories utilized by Religious Studies scholars may not always apply to nonreligion (an umbrella term which includes many types or expressions of atheism but also those who identify as agnostic, humanist, apathetic, etc.).

In this post I argue against the framework / concept of IR in general and its potential application in studying non-religion by advocating for the development of ‘implicit atheism’ (jokingly so) to demonstrate that many ‘religious people’ can be labeled as ‘implicitly atheists’. What is wrong with the concept of ‘implicit religion’? The relationship between IR and what we are now forced to term as ‘explicit religion’ is of a tyrannical hegemonic nature. If we want to know what someone ‘believes’, or doesn’t, we have to ask them. We should consider this the nature of ‘belief”. There is no such inherent thing as ‘religion in general’ or a ‘religious act’ or ‘religious emotion’ (Belzen, 2010, p. 12, 32), only things deemed to be ‘religious’ by the person carrying out the act and or displaying the emotion (Taves, 2009). If there is anything that could be considered an inherently religious act or emotion, we know that this act or emotion can be fulfilled in secular ways as well (Vergote, 1997, p.45, cf.

Pupils were asked to show me through photographs what is important in their lives, using the medium to represent people, places, objects, activities and times, as well as beliefs and values. Unlike other visual methodologies, photo-elicitation is often less concerned with the analysis and interpretation of the images per se (or with the quality of the images produced), and more concerned with the meanings and interpretations of those images expressed by participants. Following the photo-elicitation method, interview questions pursue and develop topics as they emerge in relation to pupils’ beliefs and values, their construction of meaning and purpose, and their identities and influences, as well as the material aspects of their lives. As researchers continue to study whether and how nonreligion is evident in the lives of people who report ‘no religion’, more clarity and greater understanding of this relatively new concept will develop. Thus far, much of the data emerging from this field has focused on adults who self-identify as ‘nonreligious’, but my research will complement existing studies on teenage religion and values (Francis and Kay 1995) by focusing on fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds who tick ‘no religion’, contributing to our current understanding of ‘nonreligion’ and other related concepts by demonstrating how these are manifest in the lives of ‘young nones’.","none,photo,elicitation,research,none,post,series,research,school,none,britain,simeon,wallis,benefit,photo,elicitation,interview,technique,people,experience,nonreligion,concept,theory,researcher,field,teenager,school,england,religion,photo,elicitation,interview,survey,datum,order,people,religion,pupil,photograph,life,medium,people,place,object,activity,time,belief,value,methodology,photo,elicitation,analysis,interpretation,image,quality,image,meaning,interpretation,image,participant,photo,elicitation,method,interview,question,topic,relation,pupil,belief,value,construction,meaning,purpose,identity,influence,aspect,life,researcher,nonreligion,life,people,religion,clarity,understanding,concept,datum,field,adult,self,research,study,religion,value,francis,kay,year,old,religion,understanding,nonreligion,concept,life,none"

I plan on carrying out follow-up interviews that will provide more detailed life histories and allow for one-on-one interaction. Whether or not the United States is filled with vocal and aggressive Christians is not actually relevant.  The important part to focus on is that the people at Camp Quest Montana feel that it was.

Even the Middle Ages, frequently treated as the epitome or an era of faith, was seen by medieval writers as a time of spiritual crisis, in which witchcraft, heresy and paganism were constant threats to the faith. The principal reason why our perspective of history is such that we view our own time as characteristically irreligious and contrast it with what we believe to be the prevailing faith of all previous epochs is because we live in the shade of the late nineteenth century.

Why did it take so long for academics to become interested in this particular topic? This is not an easy question to answer, and I am not sure I am best qualified to attempt to do so, but I can at least answer a not entirely unrelated question, which is how it was that I became interested in the topic of irreligion in the first place. In part the story is purely biographical, and relates to my involvement, at a relatively young age, in the Rationalist Press Association (the publishers of the magazine The Humanist), and subsequently the emerging British Humanist Movement. This meant that by the time I started my academic career in the early 1960s, I had direct personal experience of irreligious people and their organizations. Consequently, whatever the reason is for the current and long-overdue upsurge of academic interest in atheism, secularity and non-religion, I am naturally delighted that it has happened.","resurrection,sociology,irreligion,colin,campbell,professor,emeritus,sociology,pioneer,study,irreligion,publication,book,sociology,irreligion,sociology,direction,republication,work,campbell,rise,fall,project,decade,opening,sentence,sociology,irreligion,tradition,study,irreligion,book,hope,development,tradition,academic,topic,question,question,topic,irreligion,place,story,involvement,age,press,association,publisher,magazine,humanist,movement,time,career,1960,experience,people,organization,reason,upsurge,interest,atheism,secularity,religion"

He first claimed asylum in the UK in 2007 at the age of 16 on the grounds of being an unaccompanied minor, having fled violence against his family. This claim was rejected but he was granted discretionary leave to remain until 2013 (Dugan 2014). Over the intervening years living in the UK – a country in which 65% of the population identify as having little or no religious orientation (Siegers 2010) – he gradually came to identify as an atheist. The Home Office accepted the claim made on the applicant’s behalf that there would be no way for him to conduct a discreetly nonreligious way of life in Afghanistan. While this is the first case on public record worldwide in which an atheist has been granted asylum on these grounds, Article 10 of the European Council’s 2011 treaty on asylum designates atheism as possible grounds for fear of religious persecution (Pizzi 2014). Commentators have suggested that this might set a new legal precedent both for the UK and other European countries. It has been welcomed by advocates of nonreligious freedom (BBC 2014; Goldsmith 2014).","kind,war,story,atheism,freedom,mythology,sanctuary,home,office,decision,asylum,man,ground,atheism,subject,medium,interest,debate,blog,post,director,stacey,gutkowski,narrative,coverage,case,week,case,year,man,asylum,kingdom,attention,language,press,asylum,age,ground,minor,violence,family,claim,leave,dugan,year,country,population,orientation,sieger,atheist,home,office,claim,applicant,behalf,way,way,life,afghanistan,case,record,atheist,asylum,ground,article,council,treaty,asylum,atheism,ground,fear,persecution,pizzi,commentator,precedent,country,advocate,freedom,bbc,goldsmith"

But that’s the trouble. The ‘Campbell opener’ has now appeared so many times – kicking off so many new studies of atheism/nonreligion – that it can no longer possibly be true. Curiously, all this has happened astonishingly fast. Tentatively now, I think two main things are going on. Firstly, I think atheism and nonreligiosity-in-general, as features of the social and cultural landscape, have simply become so large, obvious, significant and interesting, especially in Europe and North America, that they could not continue to be ignored. Secondly, I think that the growing self-awareness of atheists and ‘nones’ themselves, as a (loose) community or movement, has spurred the social scientists among them to take a closer ‘look in the mirror’.","interest,history,neglect,growth,interest,nonreligion,secularity,nsrn,director,stephen,insight,day,scholar,atheism,secularity,nonreligion,topic,article,book,struggle,opening,line,tradition,study,irreligion,colin,campbell,book,sociology,irreligion,trouble,campbell,opener,time,study,atheism,nonreligion,thing,atheism,nonreligiosity,feature,landscape,europe,north,america,self,awareness,atheist,none,community,movement,scientist,mirror"

A recent study found an interest in spirituality amidst a continuing secular drift in the UK. The survey (2013), sponsored by the Christian think tank Theos,  found that 77 percent of the British believe in some things that could not be explained by science and other means, and that only a quarter of those surveyed thought spiritual forces had no influence on the Earth. In other words, the study suggests that even many non-religious people don’t want to be categorized as strict materialists. But what about atheists? A secular spirituality for atheists would obviously not be related to the supernatural, yet the emotional components of wonder, awe, and joy might still be present in experiences deemed secular. According to our research on American atheists (or secularists, as we call them), we found a segment of them claiming a secular spirituality. This came through in a small Internet survey of 167 participants of atheist and humanist groups we conducted in 2010.  Although not representative of all organized secularists, the survey did illuminate the views of a significant segment of this diffuse movement, which was also evident in our content analysis of secular humanist publications. When asked if they ever felt awe, wonder, even transcendence in everyday activities, a significant percentage had such experiences while being in nature (59.2), working in or reading about science (47.9), performing or listening to music (47.3), admiring or doing art (41.9), and meditation/contemplation (35.3).","atheist,spirituality,post,nonreligion,secularity,launch,series,richard,cimino,christopher,smith,idea,spirituality,thing,spirituality,study,interest,spirituality,drift,survey,think,tank,theo,percent,thing,science,mean,quarter,force,influence,earth,word,study,people,materialist,atheist,spirituality,atheist,component,wonder,awe,joy,experience,research,atheist,secularist,segment,spirituality,internet,survey,participant,group,representative,secularist,survey,view,segment,movement,content,analysis,publication,awe,wonder,transcendence,activity,percentage,experience,nature,science,music,art,meditation,contemplation"
What Do We Do When We ‘Do Life’?

In today’s blog post Anna Strhan discusses how ideas about celebrating ‘life’ and ‘reason’ among both religious and nonreligious communities also highlights lines of connection and affinity.,2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Drawing out deeper understanding of the (simultaneous) practices of connection and separation between religious and non-religious cultures can enable us to develop more nuanced understandings of the everyday realities of members of these groups, which move beyond common assumptions that their interrelations are necessarily antagonistic, and instead open up common grounds of experience. This incident not only reveals friendly institutional relationships between atheist and open evangelical churches, but the description of the atheist congregation as gathering together ‘to celebrate life’ also opens up a wider point of connection. The Sunday Assembly, for example, describes itself as ‘a godless congregation that celebrates life’ and as ‘a global network of people who want to make the most of this one life we have. Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential.’[i] This in many ways mirrors how members of both the open evangelical church and the charismatic evangelical church I am studying talk about ‘life’. Although ‘life’ and ‘reason’ may carry different resonances across these different groups, attending closely to particular concepts that are prominent in both religious and non-religious cultures may help deepen understanding of the specific affinities between different groups that we are often tempted to treat as separate.","life,relation,culture,relationship,religion,nonreligion,division,separation,today,blog,post,anna,strhan,idea,life,reason,community,line,connection,affinity,understanding,practice,connection,separation,culture,understanding,reality,member,group,assumption,interrelation,ground,experience,incident,relationship,church,description,congregation,life,point,connection,sunday,assembly,example,congregation,life,network,people,life,mission,potential,way,mirror,member,church,church,talk,life,life,reason,resonance,group,concept,culture,understanding,affinity,group"
Are Religion and Nonreligion All in the Mind?,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,NSRN director Lois Lee explains why researchers of nonreligion must look beyond purely intellectual and cognitive expressions of nonreligious rationalism.,2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The underlying rationalism has shaped the study of secularity and nonreligion hugely, encouraging investigation of abstract philosophical and political propositions. But emerging work shows how fruitful it is to think outside of this framework – to attend more equally to other dimensions and types of nonreligious culture, like the romantic forms of materialism which are quite distinct from rationalist ones; like the alternative spiritualities that sometimes understand themselves as meaningfully different to religion and which are nonreligious in that sense; or like the more expressly secular people, who are unengaged with philosophical orientations towards the world of any sort and instead derive meaning from this-worldly concerns and pleasures. A non-rationalist approach to nonreligious culture leads to investigations of how nonreligion threads through informal relationships, familiar symbolic environments and everyday practices; it extends ‘lived religion’ approaches to the study of nonreligious and secular life; and it considers how nonreligious identities of all kinds, whether rationalist or otherwise, are performed and received in private and public life. Alongside the intellectual and moral, then, we need to engage more deeply with the cultural and structural aspects of nonreligion. As all social scientists understand and feel deeply, thinking is really only one part of the picture.","religion,nonreligion,mind,nsrn,director,lois,lee,researcher,nonreligion,expression,rationalism,rationalism,study,secularity,nonreligion,investigation,proposition,work,framework,dimension,type,culture,form,materialism,one,spirituality,religion,sense,people,orientation,world,sort,meaning,concern,pleasure,approach,culture,investigation,nonreligion,relationship,environment,practice,religion,approach,study,life,identity,kind,life,aspect,nonreligion,scientist,thinking,picture"

One of the striking things that emerges is that, far from all conforming to neat-and-tidy categories of ‘religious’ or ‘atheist’, a lot of nones are pretty fuzzy too. But against the idea that there is a growing tide of hard secularism we must set the finding that most ‘nones’ are not atheists. In fact atheism has been growing far less than ‘no religion’. Most nones don’t decisively reject God. What they reject is an identification with ‘religion’, with a particular religion, and with the label ‘religious’. We find that hardly any nones go to church or read holy scriptures, take any notice of religious authorities, or pray. Their most common spiritual practice is meditation or taking time to still the mind (18%). Some say they believe in God (16%), and almost a quarter that they are influenced by religion.  But the largest category are simply indifferent to religion. So the idea that most ‘nones’ are atheists who are implacably opposed to all forms of religion or spirituality is wrong. At the end of the day, the word ‘fuzzy’ as applied to either religious or non-religious people is useful only as  placeholder.

Atheists are Believers,Stephen LeDrew,Independent scholar,United States,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Stephen LeDrew asserts that atheism is not simply the negation or absence of religion but that it involves a complex array of epistemological, ethical and political beliefs.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Atheists are also ‘believers’. I would like to clarify what I mean by this, and how approaching the topic from this point of view leads us in different directions. Atheism is commonly defined as a negation or, more passively, a lack of belief. Smith implicitly adopts this view in his analysis of interview research that finds that atheism is a ‘rejection identity’, or a belief and an identity grounded in the rejection of religion in a theistically ‘ubiquitous’ socio-cultural context.  In my reply I argue that this approach is misleading, and that atheism should be approached as a set of complex systems of beliefs.  In LeDrew (2012) I identified two major historical categories of atheism that I call ‘scientific’ and ‘humanistic’. Major categories of beliefs found in the atheist movement today include (1) the view that science is the authoritative source of knowledge and that scientific progress drives social progress, and (2) a belief in basic human equality and a perception that religion impedes social justice.  In either case atheism is not just a negation or an absence of belief, but is connected to a set of epistemological, ethical, and political positions.  When it is institutionalized in social movement organizations or public discourse, then, atheism is ideology.  This is not surprising: given that atheists are not defined as a group by similar social characteristics and therefore are not united by a common experience of structural marginalization, what would motivate this level of organization and activism other than a passionate belief in something?","atheist,believer,stephen,ledrew,atheism,negation,absence,religion,array,belief,atheist,believer,topic,point,view,direction,atheism,negation,lack,belief,smith,view,analysis,interview,research,atheism,rejection,identity,belief,identity,rejection,religion,context,reply,approach,atheism,set,system,belief,ledrew,category,atheism,category,belief,movement,today,view,science,source,knowledge,progress,progress,belief,equality,perception,religion,justice,case,atheism,negation,absence,belief,set,position,movement,organization,discourse,atheism,ideology,atheist,group,characteristic,experience,marginalization,level,organization,activism,belief"
The Divergent Discourses of Scientific and Humanistic Atheism,Lorna Mumford,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Lorna Mumford reflects on how events during her field research suggest that different atheistic discourses are utilised in response to differing aspects of concern regarding religiosity.,2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In his journal article The Evolution of Atheism: Scientific and Humanistic Approaches Stephen LeDrew provides an analytical account of developments in official atheist discourses since the publication of D’Holbach’s Systeme de la Nature in 1770. He highlights how since the nineteenth century, there has been a divergence between atheist discourses based on scientific arguments and those based on humanistic concerns. LeDrew sees this difference reflected today in the scientific approach of ‘New Atheist’ authors such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, with their more confrontational response to religious belief and the promotion of science and education as a means to achieve increased secularization, and the approach of many secular Humanist organisations, who prefer a more accommodating approach and emphasise the importance of equal treatment for both religious and nonreligious worldviews. These two divergent discourses can, and do, operate in a complimentary way, with each informing and reinforcing the other, but these initial findings suggest that, rather than describing different people and groups, the two official discourses are used by the same people and groups but function in different ways, providing arguments and responses to two separate ‘dilemmas’ regarding religiosity: the propositional elements of personal religious belief, and the perceived impact religious practices and principles have on the lives of people in society.","discourse,atheism,lorna,mumford,event,field,research,discourse,response,aspect,concern,religiosity,journal,article,evolution,atheism,approach,stephen,ledrew,account,development,discourse,publication,d’holbach,systeme,nature,century,divergence,discourse,argument,concern,ledrew,difference,today,approach,author,richard,dawkin,sam,harris,response,belief,promotion,science,education,means,secularization,approach,organisation,approach,importance,treatment,worldview,discourse,way,finding,people,group,discourse,people,group,way,argument,response,dilemma,religiosity,element,belief,impact,practice,principle,life,people,society"

These churches seek to replicate the ‘positive’ aspects of regular churches – the community, the ritual, the singing – only without the dogma. The media have taken notice of these churches, making irresistible comparisons of atheists with other religionists, most recently concerning a reported ‘schism’ between the London and New York chapters of the Sunday Assembly. What’s often missing from these kinds of media discussions, however, is that these atheist churches, and many of the dilemmas they face, are far from new. As people began to give up religion in significant numbers in nineteenth-century Europe and North America, many thinkers grappled with secular alternatives to religions, including what could be described as atheist churches. Perhaps the first attempt to transplant religious ideas into a secular framework occurred during the de-Christianisation of the French Revolution. A succession of cults dedicated to reason, to the ‘Supreme Being,’ and to theophilanthropy, sought to mimic the trappings of religion except in a deistic or atheistic guise. All these atheistic substitutes for religion have struggled with similar issues: How should they incorporate religious rituals and ceremonies while remaining secular? Should non-atheists be welcomed into their communities? How should these groups engage with political issues? Who has the authority to lead such congregations? How can these organizations build a foundation that will persist beyond a generation? These are questions that modern atheist churches struggle with – as, indeed, do many religious groups – and will only become more pressing as secularization continues and non-religious people seek to create new communities. Examining the experiences of past atheist churches might provide a guide for modern atheists as they begin to confront these issues.","church,formation,sunday,assembly,london,offshoot,part,world,attention,medium,type,gathering,nathan,alexander,overview,form,church,issue,alternative,religion,sunday,assembly,church,london,offshoot,number,city,australia,church,aspect,church,community,ritual,singing,dogma,medium,notice,church,comparison,atheist,religionist,schism,london,york,chapter,sunday,assembly,kind,medium,discussion,church,dilemma,people,religion,number,century,europe,north,america,thinker,alternative,religion,church,attempt,idea,framework,revolution,succession,cult,reason,trapping,religion,guise,substitute,religion,issue,ritual,ceremony,non,atheist,community,group,issue,authority,congregation,organization,foundation,generation,question,church,group,secularization,people,community,experience,church,guide,atheist,issue"

Mahlamäki (2012) has argued that in many different contexts around the world, women have always been more religious than men and that men are more nonreligious and atheistic than women. This concerns every dimension of religion, be it belief, practice or belonging. Women are members of both traditional religious communities and new religious movements more often than men, although men have proved to be more resolute, apparently, than women as to religious beliefs. There are female atheists but their voices seem to have been heard rather less than men’s. In the conclusion to her article Mahlamäki makes the telling point that it is the everyday forms of nonreligiousness and lived nonreligiousness which are missing from public discussion. What do these look like? Obviously there are ‘everyday forms’ for both male and female atheists, but as so little research has been conducted on women, this seems a good place to start. Additionally, as Mahlamäki raises the issue of how children of nonreligious families experience the presence of (Christian) religion (festivals, prayers, hymns) in kindergarten or at school and, given that women still seem to be the main socialisers of their children into the family’s belief systems, it is likely that by studying women we will find some possible answers to these questions.","atheism,school,research,woman,janet,eccles,religion,life,experience,nonreligiosity,date,research,woman,atheist,mahlamäki,context,world,woman,man,man,woman,dimension,religion,belief,practice,woman,member,community,movement,man,man,woman,belief,atheist,voice,man,conclusion,article,mahlamäki,telling,point,form,discussion,form,atheist,research,woman,place,mahlamäki,issue,child,family,presence,religion,festival,prayer,hymn,kindergarten,school,woman,socialiser,child,family,belief,system,woman,answer,question"

Although blasphemy laws in the UK were abolished in 2008, ingrained attitudes that are associated with them live on in the minds and actions of some. My purpose here is not to relay a chronology of the struggles atheists have faced, nor is it to advocate for the termination of perceived injustices towards atheists, but to consider the processes through which different forms of stigma arise, in particular the emergence of self-stigma. My ethnographic field-research involved immersing myself amongst self-identifying religious and nonreligious communities for an extended period of time. The results of this research exposed new ways of thinking about and understanding stigma in relation to atheistic identities. What became evident was the complexity of stigmatising behaviours. Stigma is not only imposed upon atheists by religionists but travels reversely from atheists towards religionists. Moreover, the multifariousness of religious and nonreligious communities means that stigmatisation also occurs amongst and between members of those communities. Consequently, incidences of stigmatising behaviour should be viewed less as an imposed injustice upon a minority group and more as a melee of stigma both created by, and creating, social divisions.","atheism,stigma,siân,jones,role,stigma,self,stigma,expression,self,identity,atheist,norm,blasphemy,law,attitude,mind,action,purpose,chronology,struggle,atheist,termination,injustice,atheist,process,form,stigma,emergence,self,stigma,field,research,self,community,period,time,result,research,way,stigma,relation,identity,complexity,behaviour,stigma,atheist,religionist,atheist,religionist,community,stigmatisation,member,community,incidence,behaviour,injustice,minority,group,melee,stigma,division"
Investigating the Social Cost of Atheism in the US,Kyle Thompson,Claremont Graduate University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Kyle Thompson discusses the findings of a recent U.S. study which examined how perceived religiosity might influence appraisals of moral behaviour, considers the possible social consequences for nonreligious people, and suggests avenues for future research on this topic.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"While there is little doubt that atheists are seen as the ‘other’ by people of various religions, it is quite possible that this ‘othering’ has less to do with atheists lacking a sacred text or a unified set of moral norms, and more to do with people fearing anyone who doesn’t believe in a supernatural score-keeper of some kind—whether it is the omniscient God of Abraham or the non-personal karma of various Eastern religions. Though the researchers do mention the behavioural effects of believing in supernatural punishment for wrongdoing, they fail to directly connect people’s suspicion of atheists with the fact that atheists don’t believe in gods capable of such moral punishment. Given that research from Gervais, Shariff and Norenzayan (2011) concluded that distrust of atheists is in fact linked to concerns about atheists’ disbelief in a god monitoring their behaviour, the supposition that sacred texts and ethical norms form the boundary between the religious and irreligious is inadequate in explaining anti-atheist prejudice. I suggest investigating the effects of incorporating vignettes about atheists who consider themselves ‘spiritual’ and affirm some kind of karma-like moral monitoring in the universe. if the fear stems from an atheist’s lack of supernatural monitoring, then we would expect people to be more forgiving toward spiritual atheists. Clearly there is a wealth of potential research to be added to the good work conducted by Wright and Nichols.","cost,atheism,kyle,thompson,finding,u.s,study,religiosity,appraisal,behaviour,consequence,people,avenue,research,topic,doubt,atheist,people,religion,othering,atheist,text,set,norm,people,score,keeper,kind,god,abraham,karma,religion,researcher,effect,punishment,wrongdoing,people,suspicion,atheist,fact,atheist,god,punishment,research,gervais,shariff,norenzayan,distrust,atheist,fact,concern,atheist,disbelief,god,behaviour,supposition,text,norm,boundary,prejudice,effect,vignette,atheist,kind,karma,monitoring,universe,fear,atheist,lack,monitoring,people,atheist,wealth,research,work,wright,nichols"
‘Godless Cities’ and ‘Religious Enclaves’?

This tool can be used to see how ethnicity, age, levels of education, deprivation, self-rated health and many more variables are distributed across England and Wales. However, writing for The Guardian, Nick Mead drew attention to DataShine under the headline ‘Where do all the atheists live?’ claiming that the tool shows the ‘godless cities’ of England and Wales. However, the religious and nonreligious populations are not as segregated as these maps may imply.  It is important to remember that people selecting the option ‘no religion’ might not regard themselves as atheists. Some may be agnostic, or ‘spiritual but not religious’, or they might be undecided and exploring their religious options. Deciding how to describe this group of people is always difficult, but in general researchers today prefer the terms ‘religious nones’ or ‘no religionists’ to ‘atheists’.","city,enclave,distribution,religion,nonreligion,england,wale,katherine,sisson,datum,visualisation,tool,datashine,distribution,religion,nonreligion,england,wale,datum,census,public,internet,user,distribution,datum,england,wale,thank,datashine,data,visualisation,tool,oliver,o’brien,ucl,centre,analysis,tool,ethnicity,age,level,education,deprivation,self,health,variable,england,wale,guardian,nick,mead,attention,datashine,headline,atheist,tool,city,england,wale,population,map,people,option,religion,atheist,option,group,people,researcher,today,term,none,religionist,atheist"
Disaster and Nonreligion: Secular Theodicy from Japan,Christopher Craig Brittain,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Christopher Craig Brittain discusses how the work of artist Koki Tanaka (produced in response to the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011) demonstrates ways individuals respond and adapt to situations of adversity by creating new discourses of meaning and strategies for coping, which could be described as a ‘secular theodicy’.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Human responses to disasters bring to light issues that debates over the nature of ‘nonreligion’ often do not address. There is a long tradition among nonreligious writers to assume that natural disasters undermine and refute religious belief. An example from Japan illustrates such a phenomenon. The work of the artist Koki Tanaka offers a nonreligious examination of how people respond to unusual situations and in the process must construct new attitudes towards meaning. By exploring this issue as a way to examine how people cope with disaster, his work resembles the process formerly associated with theodicy. These ‘Precarious Tasks’ highlight how issues of identity, meaning, and orientation towards the future are often profoundly disrupted by intense experiences of insecurity. The questions Tanaka explores thus resemble those formerly associated with religion in general, and theodicy in particular. These artworks bring into view how one of the challenges of our environmentally unstable era is to learn how to pattern our lives in the presence of ongoing threats and uncertainties. As such, Tanaka’s work can be understood as exploring the nature of ‘secular theodicy’.","disaster,nonreligion,theodicy,japan,christopher,craig,brittain,work,artist,koki,tanaka,response,earthquake,tsunami,japan,way,individual,situation,adversity,discourse,meaning,strategy,theodicy,response,disaster,issue,nature,nonreligion,tradition,writer,disaster,belief,example,japan,phenomenon,work,artist,koki,tanaka,examination,people,situation,process,attitude,meaning,issue,way,people,disaster,work,process,theodicy,task,issue,identity,meaning,orientation,future,experience,insecurity,question,tanaka,religion,theodicy,artwork,view,challenge,era,life,presence,threat,uncertainty,tanaka,work,nature,theodicy"

This important question – for atheists and those who study atheism – is difficult to answer because it is not easy to see what the bluntness of the new atheists has in common with the subtlety of other philosophers of nonreligion, such as Richard Rorty or William Connolly. Instead of attempting to find a unifying theory of atheism, I have proposed, in a recent article published in Telos, that we need a dialectic theory of atheology. In terms of the theory of atheology, we can identify three such Hegelian moments in the history of atheism – and indeed in contemporary atheist discourse. The first movement is a largely negative one, which I label ‘a-theology’. What is a potential positive side of this atheology? Atheology can also be described as an atheo-logy, as the antithesis to the a-theology described above. This atheo-logy is a systematic understanding of the fight against particular understandings of God. The focus, I argue in the article, is between those who recognize atheism as a belief, and those who do not. The third phase can be labeled a ‘metatheology’, one that moves beyond (meta-) both theistic claims and, necessarily, simple atheistic claims as well. Atheology has not yet managed to move past these negative and positive phases, to build something radically different from what other religious doxa have built.","dialectic,atheology,past,future,atheism,charles,devellenne,idea,dialectic,theory,atheology,alternative,form,atheism,continuity,strand,atheism,difference,question,atheist,atheism,bluntness,atheist,subtlety,philosopher,nonreligion,richard,rorty,william,connolly,theory,atheism,article,telos,dialectic,theory,atheology,term,theory,atheology,moment,history,atheism,discourse,movement,theology,atheology,atheology,atheo,logy,antithesis,theology,atheo,logy,understanding,fight,understanding,god,focus,article,atheism,belief,phase,metatheology,meta-,claim,claim,atheology,phase,doxa"

In brief, according to some surveys the Japanese populace seems secular, while measures of religious identification and church/shrine attendance suggest a vibrantly religious country. What is more, the average Japanese person belongs to not one, but multiple religions. By the conventional categories of Euro-American thought, Japanese have more religious diversity than they have people, and they lack ‘religion’ while frequently attending religious institutions. So how do we account for this apparently contradictory intersection of religion and secularism (no religion)? I’d like to turn to the history of the category ‘religion’ in Japan to find some answers to this puzzle. In sum, this means that while it is possible to talk about atheism, secularism, or nonreligion in Japan, one has to be careful not to import assumptions from the specifically Christian formulations of the category ‘religion.’ Moreover, I argue that the paradoxes are not in Japanese culture; so much as they highlight the contradictions of the concept of religion itself and push at the limits of its globalization.","paradox,secularism,japan,jason,ānanda,josephson,evidence,japan,complexity,euro,understanding,concept,religion,nonreligion,secularism,context,research,pass,paradox,brief,survey,populace,measure,identification,church,shrine,attendance,country,person,religion,category,euro,thought,japanese,diversity,people,religion,institution,intersection,religion,secularism,religion,history,category,religion,japan,answer,puzzle,sum,atheism,secularism,nonreligion,japan,assumption,formulation,category,religion,paradox,culture,contradiction,concept,religion,limit,globalization"

Likewise, ideological labels rarely reflect the pragmatic ways human beings appropriate, revise, and apply those ideologies based on the needs of the moment. Historians of nonreligion, who often trace the social history of ideas, need to be keenly aware of this fact. For example, the twentieth century saw a wide variety of labels applied to unbelievers: from rationalists, humanists and freethinkers, to secular socialists, anarchists and communists. Their diversity has been one reason that a unified social history of unbelief has been slow to develop. A broader approach is possible, but it will require historians to look at unbelievers not just as repositories of a particular intellectual formulation, but as people who took practical steps to navigate and contest a culture that was hostile to their views.","god,blaster,atheist,division,unbeliever,elliot,hanowski,history,unbelief,label,way,unbeliever,stripe,society,idea,society,label,way,being,ideology,need,moment,historian,nonreligion,history,idea,fact,example,century,variety,label,unbeliever,rationalist,humanist,freethinker,socialist,anarchist,communist,diversity,reason,history,unbelief,approach,historian,unbeliever,repository,formulation,people,step,culture,view"

Yet, with an almost universal rise in rates of non-affiliation across the West, little is known on how this effect has evolved. I attempt to shed some light on these questions with data from the 2008 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). To summarize, the unaffiliated are more liberal when it comes to family values in regions where they form larger groups. This creates a greater divide between the unaffiliated and the religiously committed in such areas. With most regions seeing an increase in their numbers of religious ‘nones’, this indicates that if they are not already characterised by this greater divide, they may be so in the near future. Since an individual’s value orientation tends to influence her/his political choices as well as other behaviour, these greater divides could be leading to greater social cleavages between the actively religious and the unaffiliated in many Western societies.","none,family,value,area,disaffiliation,study,sarah,wilkins,laflamme,none,commitment,family,value,area,disaffiliation,value,divide,neighbour,time,time,religion,view,gender,role,sexuality,abortion,nation,rise,rate,non,affiliation,west,effect,light,question,datum,survey,programme,issp,family,value,region,group,divide,area,region,increase,number,none,divide,future,individual,value,orientation,choice,behaviour,divide,cleavage,society"

Findings suggest that boundary work in face-to-face community settings helps to crystallize individual and group identity as they navigate through a social world that, for the most part, disagrees with them. Like any ideological camp, the atheist movement, and the small organizations investigated in this study, encounter plenty of diverging opinions from inside their organizations as well. Additionally, this group utilizes new media and social networking online as a component of community as well as a platform for building and broadcasting identity.

We asked nonbelievers from the United States if they could form an image of a hypothetical divine figure. Of 520 participants, 81% were able to form an image of a divine figure. While images based on popular religious teachings were the most common, images based on previously held religious beliefs and other personal ideas were also reported. Participants then rated the characteristics of the hypothetical divine figure using the God-10, which measures the degree to which a divine figure is seen as cruel, distant, or loving. Compared to religious believers, nonbelievers described their imagined divine figures as somewhat crueler and substantially more distant and less loving. Participants later answered two questions about what they would say in an encounter with an imagined god and how this god would respond. Most participants did respond to these questions, and several themes emerged which paralleled the God-10 results. While many nonbelievers asked questions about the purpose of suffering and the god’s absence, there were few angry responses or accusations of sadism.

Organizational Variation in the Nonreligious Community,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With the rapid rise of religious non-affiliation in the United States over the past two decades, scholars have recently produced impressive work on the topic of nonreligion. However, little work has focused specifically on the role organized nonreligion plays in shaping a nonreligious identity, or the organizational variation that exists within the nonreligious community. How do different organizational types affect the development, maintenance, and salience of a nonreligious identity, and how might the individual and collective identities of members in turn affect organizational identity (i.e., the features that an organization is expected to possess)? My dissertation aims to uncover answers to these questions. I expect that a typology of nonreligious organizational identity can be developed, similar to the typologies of nonreligious individual identity currently being explored. This research will add to existing knowledge of nonreligion in the United States; American nonreligion is likely as diverse a phenomenon as American religion, and current research is only beginning to reflect this reality. I will investigate these topics using various qualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews with nonbelievers, which will include a significant sample of nonbelievers who are not involved with a nonreligious organization, in order to control for the actual effect of organizational membership on nonreligious identity.

Bakunin, for example, rejected both “God and the State.” However, in the contemporary world, secular political authority remains the best pragmatic mechanism for the development of nonreligion, since secular political systems defend the rights of nonbelievers.

In a situation in which religious indifference and strict religiosity were shown to be growing simultaneously in the modern world, yet the phenomenon of convinced irreligion was largely ignored, I set out several years ago to answer the question: Who are the decided, committed, and organized atheists and what drives their activism in different socio-religious settings within Western societies? This research was completed in late 2013. The results are based on 58 qualitative in-depth interviews with members from local atheist organizations, which offer their members community as well as chances for participation in political activism and which are conceptualized as part of a broader freethoughtsecularist movement. Despite their highly diverse religious / nonreligious backgrounds and biographies, processes of joining, and strategies and degrees of activism, eight distinctive types of members were identified. These are based on recurring narrative and action patterns (“motives”). The motive of political conflict unites the “Political Fighter” and the “Indignant”, the motive of belonging unites the “Collectivist” and the “Alienated”, the motive 16 of philosophical and religious knowledge unites the “Intellectual Enlightener” and the “Silent Intellectual”, while finally the motive of identification with the organization is central to the “Dissociate” as well as to the “Euphoric”. These types show the face of organized atheism to be very diverse and to be much more than and different from the caricature of “militant atheists” that has dominated public perception of the movement in recent years (in much of whatever little notice it has received).",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"atheism,typology,member,freethought,movement,paper,result,research,member,organization,state,germany,situation,indifference,religiosity,world,phenomenon,irreligion,year,question,atheist,activism,setting,society,research,result,depth,interview,member,organization,member,community,chance,participation,activism,movement,background,biography,process,strategy,degree,activism,type,member,narrative,action,pattern,motive,motive,conflict,fighter,motive,motive,knowledge,enlightener,motive,identification,organization,dissociate,type,face,atheism,caricature,atheist,perception,movement,year,notice"

For if, the reasoning seems to have gone, the reading public was ready to read strongly anti-religious works of the polemical type it stood to reason they would be interested in reading the stories of how people became atheists, especially in a book culture as saturated with memoirs as our own. But if the emergence of the atheist memoir is not that surprising, what is a little more surprising is the emergence of a whole new genre of spiritual autobiography, what I will call the “deconversion story,” in which the memoirist accounts for their loss of faith (usually in Christianity) in strikingly (and often self-consciously) parallel terms to the conversion narratives of that faith. So where one had come to Jesus before now one embraces atheism. Where there are a number of criticisms one might level against this structure (not least the rather strange instance of converting to a belief you don’t have) and against the New Atheist polemic more generally, these deconversion stories are particularly interesting given that so much of the New Atheist polemic (as noted by critics like David Bentley Hart and Terry Eagleton) is rooted in anecdotes and personal narratives rather than abstract argument. In addition to an engagement with the structural imperatives of the conversion narrative form, I argue recent discussions in cognitive science and psychology, especially debates about both memory and belief formation, may be helpful in understanding the form and especially the content of the deconversion narrative. In effect I suggest that these neurological axioms diagnose an etiology of one of the more perplexing trends in recent life writing about nonreligion: the degree to which conversion relies upon narratives of experience whereas deconversion seems to rely upon narratives of evidence.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"day,success,god,delusion,letter,nation,rest,atheist,work,surprise,publisher,moment,work,memoir,atheist,reasoning,public,work,type,reason,story,people,atheist,book,culture,memoir,emergence,memoir,emergence,genre,autobiography,deconversion,story,memoirist,loss,faith,christianity,self,term,conversion,narrative,faith,jesus,atheism,number,criticism,structure,instance,belief,polemic,deconversion,story,polemic,critic,david,bentley,hart,terry,eagleton,anecdote,narrative,argument,addition,engagement,imperative,conversion,narrative,form,discussion,science,psychology,debate,memory,belief,formation,form,content,deconversion,narrative,effect,axiom,etiology,trend,life,nonreligion,degree,conversion,narrative,experience,deconversion,narrative,evidence"
Examining Low Religiousness Among University Students in Istanbul,Catherine Caldwell-Harris,Boston University,Massachusetts,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"College students in Istanbul are surrounded by considerable contradictions. The life-style of a cosmopolitan European city beckons, but family life frequently retains traditional values such as skepticism of western behaviors like dating. A key source of tension for young people is religion. Turkey has a history as a secular state, but religious political parties and culturally powerful groups like Gülen have grown in importance in recent decades. To learn more about religious attitudes among young adults in this rapidly changing region, we surveyed 200 students at Istanbul University. Students completed an Islamic version of the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS), along with personality measures. Using the ROS categories, 37% of students were high on both intrinsic and extrinsic subscales, 13% were extrinsic, 14% intrinsic, while 36% were low/nonreligious. This group responded 'disagree’ on average to most questions, thus rejecting statements such as Unless conditions are blocked, I fast in the month of Ramadan. In several recent western studies, possessing an analytical reasoning style was associated with atheism. We examined this using the Cognitive Reflections Test (CRT) and the Rational Experiential Inventory (REI). To obtain correct answers on the math problems of the CRT, respondents must inhibit responding with an intuitive but false answer. Correct answers on the CRT negatively correlated with ROS extrinsic orientation, r= -0.45. The REI sub-scores measuring Rational Engagement correlated with ROS extrinsic at r= -0.35, a new finding in the literature (our team previously found a trend in this direction with American college students). No relationships were found between religiousness and the broader autism phenotype (using the Autism Quotient) in contrast to several western studies.

"Michel Foucault, Religion & the Theatrical Work of Jerzy Grotowski",Catherine Christof,Loyola Marymount University,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper I will locate the work of Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski (1933 – 1999) in the context of Michel Foucault’s poststructuralist concepts, particularly those regarding the body, history and Christianity. I will investigate two plays within Grotowski’s Theatre of Productions phase to see if they indeed did manifest the boundary-defying exploration of ideological structures that Foucault’s inquiries offer to religious studies work. I will then delve more specifically into the use of what religious studies scholar Thomas Beaudoin calls a 'Foucaultian imperative’ in art, demonstrating that Grotowski’s work could be seen to manifest a new way of religious knowing through a secular realization of theatre art. I will use Foucault’s work through the traditions of religious studies scholars Jeremy Carrette and James Bernauer to challenge the place of the body in the understanding of religion. By using Foucault as an interpretive theoretical framework, religion and the body can be linked much more effectively.

"“I Know It When I See It:” Humanism, Secularism, and Religious Taxonomy",Charles Louis Richter,George Washington University,Washington,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Few outside the academic study of religion have thought very hard about how “religion” might be defined. If pressed, they may employ the same definition that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart used when he defined “hard-core pornography” in 1964: “I know it when I see it.” The tendency toward such an intuitive definition of religion opens the door to confusion in communication—and potentially in policy. For most Americans, the terms “religion” and “church,” when used to describe broader categories, retain Christian connotations of structure, belief, and practice. These connotations are retained when they attempt to describe—in terms of religion—“secular humanism” or other quasi-religious philosophies or movements. This paper argues that secular humanism is a disruptive concept that brings to light the normative quality of religious worldviews. This paper will examine how observers who “know it when they see it” have taxonomized secular humanism and other examples of non-religion/irreligion as religions. The inclusion since the 1920s of “humanism” in catalogues of religious movements shows an evolving response to the concept that shifts with the perceived prevalence of irreligion in society, as well as the relationship between religion, irreligion, and the state. The modern case study of the Sunday Assembly, a “godless church” that started in England in 2013 and has toured North America seeding new congregations, provides a useful example of how the criteria of belief, ritual, dogma, and community are employed by both critics and supporters of the movement to evaluate its religious/ irreligious/non-religious status.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"humanism,secularism,taxonomy,study,religion,religion,definition,court,justice,potter,stewart,core,pornography,tendency,definition,religion,door,confusion,communication,policy,american,term,religion,church,category,connotation,structure,belief,practice,connotation,term,humanism,philosophy,movement,paper,humanism,concept,quality,worldview,paper,observer,humanism,example,religion,irreligion,religion,inclusion,humanism,catalogue,movement,response,concept,prevalence,irreligion,society,relationship,religion,irreligion,state,case,study,sunday,assembly,church,england,north,america,congregation,example,criterion,belief,ritual,dogma,community,critic,supporter,movement,status"
Increasing Diversity in Emerging Non-religious Communities,Christopher Hassall,University of Leeds,England,M,Ian Bushfield,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary growth in non-religious populations has given rise to novel communities with unique perspectives on social issues.

Diversity among speakers (defined using multivariate statistics in terms of the representation of women and non-white people) increased significantly over time during the period studied. This broadening participation may have arisen from interventions to address issues of representation or may simply reflect a generational shift in the demographics of the community.

Believing and Belonging – or not?: Trends and Predictors of Religious Belief and Belonging in the United States,Darren Sherkat,Southern Illinois University,Illinois,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last two decades, religious scholars and pundits have increasingly argued that Europeans and Americans “believe, but don’t belong.” It is a comforting analysis for people with religious commitments, since it suggests that the rising proportion of people who don’t identify with religion, nonetheless believe in the Christian gods or the divine inspiration of Christian sacred texts. Yet, recent studies also show that belief in gods are also on the wane, and that more Americans reject the divine inspiration for Christian sacred texts. Further, many who do not believe are compelled to identify with religious groups or to participate in religious services, and this may well have been the norm in prior generations. In this paper, I use data from the 1984-2012 General Social Surveys to examine trends in believing and belonging. I focus on two measures of religious belief—non-theism and secular views of the Bible, and two measures of religious belonging—non-identification and less than yearly religious participation. I compare trends over time and across generations for (1) believing belongers; (2) believers who don’t belong; (3) non-believers who belong; and (4) people who don’t believe or belong.

Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in God’s Existence: A Quantitative Approach,David F. Bradley,Case Western University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research exploring why some individuals do not believe in the existence of a god or gods has largely been theory-driven, drawing from psychoanalytical, cognitive, or evolutionary theories. This has left a fundamental gap in our understanding: What reasons do nonbelievers themselves give for their nonbelief? Drawing on previous studies, this project aimed to develop and provide initial validity testing of a measure to capture these reasons: the Reasons of Atheists/Agnostics for 8 Nonbelief in God’s Existence Scale (RANGES). Participants (N = 520) were adults drawn from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk worker database. An initial item pool was developed based on a review of relevant literature and responses to open-ended questions in prior studies. The item pool was refined based on feedback from several academic researchers and non-academics who write about nonbelief. Responses to the measure were subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed a ninefactor solution: Socialization-Past, Socialization-Current, Bad Experiences with Religion, Societal Concerns, Intellectual, God Relational, Emotional, Intuitive, and Agnostic. The obtained factors were subjected to initial validity testing across a number of variables, including attitudes toward God or religion and previous measures of nonreligious identity and doubt. Correlation and multiple regression generally supported the construct validity of the measure’s subscales. Nonbelievers endorsed Intellectual reasons most strongly, followed by Agnostic, Societal Concerns, and Intuitive reasons. God Relational, Bad Experiences with Religion, Emotional, and Socialization reasons for nonbelief were endorsed less strongly. These results can help inform our understanding of the structure of nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"self,reason,nonbelief,god,existence,approach,research,individual,existence,god,god,theory,theory,gap,understanding,reason,nonbeliever,nonbelief,study,project,validity,testing,measure,reason,reason,atheist,agnostic,nonbelief,god,existence,scale,participant,adult,amazon,turk,worker,database,item,pool,review,literature,response,question,study,item,pool,feedback,researcher,non,academic,nonbelief,response,measure,factor,analysis,factor,analysis,ninefactor,solution,socialization,past,socialization,experience,religion,concern,god,factor,validity,testing,number,variable,attitude,god,religion,measure,identity,doubt,correlation,regression,construct,validity,measure,subscale,nonbeliever,reason,concern,reason,god,experience,religion,socialization,reason,nonbelief,result,understanding,structure,nonbelief"
"Your Wedding, Your Way: Personalized, Non-Religious Weddings through the Universal Life Church",Dusty Hoesly,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Major national news outlets such as The New York Times have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or weddings conducted under its auspices. According to my initial research findings, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them self-describe as non-religious, usually as agnostic, atheist, apathetic, secular, or spiritual. Similarly, they describe their weddings in non-religious terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most religious language. These secular or spiritual wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. Using original survey, interview, and participant observation data, this paper explores why “secular” people employ ULC-ordained ministers for their weddings, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as religious and secular can be coconstitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"wedding,way,wedding,life,church,news,outlet,york,time,wedding,state,people,minister,friend,relative,couple,purpose,organization,minister,wedding,life,church,ulc,people,date,study,ulc,wedding,auspex,research,finding,ulc,minister,couple,self,wedding,term,personalization,ceremony,belief,taste,exclusion,language,wedding,ceremony,couple,desire,alternative,ceremony,rite,survey,interview,participant,observation,datum,paper,people,ulc,minister,wedding,ulc,minister,couple,label,wedding,ceremony,examination,ulc,wedding,diversity,self,identification,lifecycle,ritualization"
Atheist Exceptionalism: The Definition and Legality of Atheism under the First Amendment,Ethan G. Quillen,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For my Doctoral Thesis I employed a discursive analysis to the field of scholarly definitions of Atheism in order to alleviate the need to either define the term anew, or adopt a particular definition. This methodology granted me the freedom to see how individuals might shape their Atheist identities based upon the particular influences that have shaped the scholarly discourse on how the concept itself is defined. What this paper intends is a similar analysis, using the discursive method to interpret a judicial field in order to understand how the concept is addressed, defined, and given agency by means of legal limitations. In the 17 collection of worldwide political organizations, the United States is exceptional in the sense of its intricate legal system based upon a Constitution and its subsequent Amendments, as well as the Supreme Court’s position in overseeing and determining the legality of the citizenry’s religious actions in relation to that Constitution. As a discursive field, the decisions made by the court in regards to Atheism reveal to us an interesting perspective on how the concept is defined legally, especially in relation to its 'legality’ under the First Amendment’s two clauses concerning the disestablishment of a 'national religion’ and the free exercise granted the American citizenry. This paper will discuss this 'legality’ across three case studies—public education, oath requirements, and public displays—in order to see how certain decisions by the Court have offered both a judicial definition of Atheism, as well as where this definition places Atheism—and Atheists—within the American Civil Religion.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"exceptionalism,definition,legality,atheism,amendment,thesis,analysis,field,definition,atheism,order,need,term,definition,methodology,freedom,individual,identity,influence,discourse,concept,paper,analysis,method,field,order,concept,agency,mean,limitation,collection,organization,state,sense,system,constitution,amendment,court,position,legality,citizenry,action,relation,constitution,field,decision,court,regard,atheism,perspective,concept,relation,legality,amendment,clause,religion,exercise,citizenry,paper,legality,case,study,education,oath,requirement,display,order,decision,court,definition,atheism,definition,place,atheism,atheist,religion"
Looking for a 'God-Shaped Hole’: The Political Dimensions of Religiosity and Anti-Atheist Attitudes,Evan Stewart,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The current literature on negative attitudes towards atheists reports many Americans carry cultural prejudice, seeing them as immoral, cynical, and hedonistic, and that individuals with high levels of religiosity are more likely to hold these kinds of biases. That story may be too simple, though, because we do not know what kinds of religiosity are associated with these attitudes. Existing literature on the topic often mixes indicators of distinct religious constructs or narrowly chooses indicators of only one type of religiosity. Using a combination of structural equation and ordered logit modeling with 2014 survey data from The American Mosaic Project, this paper demonstrates that high religious centrality—a personal identity favoring the integration of faith with other roles in public life—is distinctly and significantly associated with both public and private distrust of atheists unlike other forms of frequent religious participation or high religious orthodoxy. This centrality also has a strong Christian component and is explicitly political. It is expressed in relationships among survey questions probing respondents’ personal religiosity and their expectation that good citizens and competent leaders will be both Christian and religious, respectively. Substantively, these results lend support for a theoretical account of citizenship which incorporates a critical approach to studying dominant cultural forms of religiosity in the United States. They also suggest that it is methodologically prudent to carefully distinguish respondents’ constructs of religiosity when attempting to explain negative attitudes towards religious and non-religious minority groups.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"hole,dimension,religiosity,attitude,literature,attitude,atheist,american,prejudice,individual,level,religiosity,kind,bias,story,kind,religiosity,attitude,literature,topic,indicator,construct,indicator,type,religiosity,combination,equation,logit,modeling,survey,datum,project,paper,centrality,identity,integration,faith,role,life,distrust,atheist,form,participation,orthodoxy,centrality,component,relationship,survey,question,respondent,religiosity,expectation,citizen,leader,result,support,account,citizenship,approach,form,religiosity,state,respondent,construct,religiosity,attitude,minority,group"
The Nones Shall Always Be with Us: Toward an Historical Perspective on Unbelief in America,Gordon J. Melton,Baylor University,Texas,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The years of the 21st century have been marked by the heightened visibility of the American community of Unbelief (atheists, humanists, freethinkers), a growth of Christian antiatheist rhetoric led by periodic papal pronouncements, and the most recent discovery of a seemingly growing community of “nones,” people variously defined as disassociated from any religious community and/or lacking any religious preference/ identity, which has led at times to the nones being identified with the community of Unbelief in things religious or supernatural. Reflection on this state of affairs is provided by an assemblage of two sets of data. First, the historical data on religious affiliation in America through the 19th and early 20th centuries indicates that the “nones” provided a far greater percentage of the population, being the majority in the decades prior to World War II. Simultaneously, unbelief, first manifest at the end of the 18th century as deism, survived and grew through the 19th century as freethought and through the 20thcentury in a variety of movements—Ethical Culture, Marxism, atheism, and Humanism. By 1940, some 4 to 5 percent of the population identified themselves as non-theists. Projecting the historical trends into the future, the Unbelief community has grown substantially through the last half of the twentieth century to the present, though it remains as the same 4 to five percent of the population (12 to 15 million. In that time, however, it has developed more than a half-dozen national organizations, each with local communities scattered across the continent, an organized base that provides the potential of substantial growth in the next generation.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"none,perspective,unbelief,america,year,century,visibility,community,unbelief,atheist,humanist,freethinker,growth,rhetoric,pronouncement,discovery,community,none,people,community,preference/,identity,time,none,community,unbelief,thing,reflection,state,affair,assemblage,set,datum,datum,affiliation,america,century,none,percentage,population,majority,decade,world,war,unbelief,end,century,deism,century,freethought,20thcentury,variety,movement,culture,marxism,atheism,humanism,percent,population,non,theist,trend,future,unbelief,community,half,century,present,percent,population,time,dozen,organization,community,continent,base,potential,growth,generation"
Belonging without Believing: Secular Functions of Churches in Northern Europe,Isabella Kasselstrand,Colorado Mesa University,Colorado,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Levels of religious beliefs, practices, and identification are at the center of the current debate on European secularization. Grace Davie (e.g. 1990; 2002) argues that Europeans believe without belonging, referring to high levels of individualized understandings of the supernatural, while active participation is low. In contrast, I argue that attendance alone offers a limited understanding of religious belonging, and that many Northern Europeans, particularly Scandinavians, belong without believing, in that they support and indentify with latent, secular functions of churches while they no longer believe. This study uses a mixedmethods approach comprised of in-depth interviews as well as quantitative data from the International Social Survey Program and the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey. While figures of religious belief and belonging are frequently presented in the literature, few explain and highlight such findings with qualitative data. Scotland and Sweden were chosen as two comparative case studies from the relatively secularized Northern Europe. Findings reveal that a majority of Swedes are culturally religious (e.g. Zuckerman, 2008) as they do not believe but still identify with the Church of Sweden, which serves a largely secular purpose as part of a cultural heritage and as a provider of life cycle ceremonies. In Scotland, on the other hand, belonging without believing is more closely associated with a sense of community or cultural defense (e.g. Bruce, 2002) in a nation that is more religiously diverse. The findings ultimately draw attention to the importance of context and conceptualization in the study of distinct and multidimensional processes of secularization.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"function,church,europe,level,belief,practice,identification,center,debate,secularization,grace,davie,e.g.,european,level,understanding,participation,contrast,attendance,understanding,belonging,european,scandinavian,function,church,study,mixedmethod,approach,depth,interview,datum,survey,program,attitude,survey,figure,belief,belonging,literature,finding,datum,scotland,sweden,case,study,europe,finding,majority,swede,e.g.,zuckerman,church,sweden,purpose,heritage,provider,life,cycle,ceremony,scotland,hand,sense,community,defense,e.g.,bruce,nation,finding,attention,importance,context,study,process,secularization"
Atheist Churches: All of the Community with “None” of the Theology,Jacqui Frost,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Many have shown that religious involvement is one of the most common gateways into other forms of civic and community involvement in America, with the church being both a physical and ideological anchor around which community and morality are built. As younger cohorts are associating with organized religion less and less, many fear that America is in a “crisis of community” in which an increase in individualism and a decrease in religious affiliation has led to a decline in group membership and social networks, which in turn has led to a decline in reciprocity and trust amongst Americans. However, instead of retreating from community involvement, a large portion of these “nones” are instead forming their own voluntary associations, even churches, in response to a lack of secular outlets for community and civic engagement. This research is an ethnographic exploration of one of these communities - The Sunday Assembly. Founded in 2013 and dubbed an “atheist church” by the media, this group expects to have 100 “assemblies” worldwide by the end of 2014. Through in-depth interviews with organizers and members of one smaller, local group, as well as participant observation at their gatherings, I explore how this group is both copying and re-molding the church model in order to build a secular community around bettering themselves and their communities without invoking religious ideologies, in many ways complicating the crisis of community thesis.

The Politics of Secularism and the Paradox of a ChristianAmerican Ethos,Jeffrey Murico,San Diego State University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper analyzes the presence of secularization debates in the political arena in order to reveal a prevalent paradoxical Christian-American ethos. In short, this paper argues that those who are concerned with the encroachment of “secularism” are themselves secularizing various aspects of “religion” when engaging in the political process. Citing multiple examples, but focusing on one case study in more depth – the Mount Soledad Cross controversy - this paper argues that in each of these cases, those who seek to defend “the religious” from the threat of “secularism” are ultimately the ones doing the secularizing. Since 1913, some form of a cross has stood in the center of a public city park atop Mount Soledad in San Diego, California despite efforts by separationists to remove it who claim that its existence and maintenance is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Defenders of the cross argue that its existence on public land is Constitutional because the cross is not a religious symbol. Rather, they argue that the cross should be understood as a secular symbol – one that represents American identity, patriotism, and military service. This particular approach, I argue, is representative of a wider, paradoxical Christian-American ethos where “defenders of Christianity” resort to secularizing “the religious” as an attempt to preserve what they hold to be sacred. In order to preserve the cross in its current location, appellants are arguing that the cross has been divested of its religious meaning. In the end, such tactics contribute to, rather than defend against, the secularization process.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"politic,secularism,paradox,ethos,paper,presence,secularization,debate,arena,order,ethos,paper,encroachment,secularism,aspect,religion,process,example,case,study,depth,mount,soledad,controversy,paper,case,religious,threat,secularism,one,secularizing,form,cross,center,city,park,soledad,san,diego,california,effort,separationist,existence,maintenance,violation,establishment,clause,defender,cross,existence,land,cross,symbol,cross,symbol,identity,patriotism,service,approach,ethos,defender,christianity,resort,attempt,order,cross,location,appellant,cross,meaning,end,tactic,secularization,process"
Transformations of Self and Society in Modern Egypt,Jeffrey T. Kenney,DePauw University,Indiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to measures such as the World Values Survey, Muslim-majority nations like Egypt constitute the most religious, and thus the least secularized, regions of the globe. Voices of atheism can be heard in Egypt, and they are becoming more forceful, but they are rare and draw attention more for their novelty than their social and political significance. Indeed, rational discussions about secularism/secularization in Egypt have been made difficult by an array of factors: the legacy of Western colonialism, authoritarian politics, a forceful Islamist opposition, and ongoing cultural debates about modern identity and authenticity. But signs of liberalism are evident in the emerging consumer culture. Egyptians are coming to see themselves, and express their identities, like many others around the world: in terms of class and the power to consume. And this trend has opened up the possibility for what one author has termed “cultural extroversion”—the capacity of Muslims to interpret lifestyle choice as coincident with religion. My presentation will explore the growing trend in self-help and personal development literature in Egypt, situating it within the demands of global capitalism and the psychological values of the enterprising self. Self-help, whether in Egypt or the US, legitimizes a turn inward, to explore and nurture the true self—a self often portrayed as hidden or suppressed by the dictates of traditional mores. The result of such self-exploration is not a rejection of Islam as much as it is its transvaluation: envisioning Muhammad as the Muslim Dale Carnegie or Allah as life coach. Through an analysis of selfhelp literature, I will analyze how the inroad of capitalism in Egypt is reshaping notions of the self, away from traditional Islamic notions to a self more in line with global capitalist culture.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"transformation,self,society,egypt,measure,world,value,majority,nation,egypt,region,globe,voice,atheism,egypt,attention,novelty,significance,discussion,secularism,secularization,egypt,array,factor,legacy,colonialism,politic,opposition,debate,identity,authenticity,sign,liberalism,consumer,culture,egyptian,identity,world,term,class,power,trend,possibility,author,capacity,muslim,lifestyle,choice,religion,presentation,trend,self,help,development,literature,egypt,demand,capitalism,value,self,self,help,egypt,turn,self,self,dictate,more,result,self,exploration,rejection,islam,transvaluation,muhammad,dale,carnegie,allah,life,coach,analysis,selfhelp,literature,inroad,capitalism,egypt,notion,self,notion,self,line,culture"

Sociologists from Max Weber and Emile Durkheim to modern theorists such as Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson have argued that as societies modernize there is a dramatic decline in religious adherence, authority, and influence. Alternative models, which stress the centrality of free-markets and the inverse correlation between existential security and religiosity, are posited to explain the exceptional position of modern societies that remain highly religious. The pages that follow apply the theories above in order to elucidate the process of secularization in the Iranian context. Two questions are germane to this task: 1.) How has Khomeini’s Islamic Revolution, the quintessential example of political Islam, led to the demise of Islamist tendencies in Iran and 2.)

Amidst their varied views on the supernatural and the afterlife, overall most religious nones believe that they are free and openminded relative to those who are deeply religious, they believe that they have meaning and purpose in life, they reject the assertion that humans need religion to be moral, and they adamantly oppose those who force their religion on to others – and this includes religious nones who do not believe that they ought to convince others to also become religious nones. In total these findings resonate with a pervasive and growing Canadian secular ethos that rejects exclusive belief systems, prides itself on the stance that religion is an individual and private matter, and opposes forcing one’s beliefs on to another – all in the name of protecting cultural ideals of diversity, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"none,canada,exploration,nation,none,canada,none,onequarter,adult,teen,today,group,context,interview,none,paper,benefit,belief,meaning,purpose,life,afterlife,morality,aversion,religion,view,afterlife,none,relative,meaning,purpose,life,assertion,human,religion,religion,none,none,finding,ethos,belief,system,stance,religion,matter,belief,ideal,diversity,pluralism,tolerance,individualism"
Polysecularity and Types of Nonbelief: Framing the Field of Secular Studies,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The affirmative commitments of nonreligious people leave them generally uninterested in personal religiosity, and keep them at relative distance apart from organized religions. This nonreligiosity is poorly characterized in terms of some “religious deficit” model, as if nonreligiosity should be framed by cognitive/ affective disabilities to be religious (e.g. a deficit in mentalization or theory of mind). Nor should nonreligiosity be framed in terms of any “religious aversion” model, supposing that the nonreligious person suffers from compulsive aversions to religion’s communal, compliance, or character demands. The establishment and development of Secular Studies has been obstructed by theological stereotypes for the nonreligious: the 'secular’ involves insensitivity or impassivity to religious wonders, or secularity is the realm of rudely materialistic and utilitarian matters, or secularity may be a manifestation of 'anti-religious’ antagonisms. Fair research into the thoughts and motives of nonreligious people should instead begin with them in their own lived worlds, not just contrasted against idealized theological portraits of religious people in theirs. Secularity should no longer be conceptualized solely in terms of regrettable deviations from hegemonic theological norms. The enjoyment of rewarding worldly pursuits, the concern for sound social relationships, and the engagement with important civic issues are prominent modes of functional secular living displayed across historical time periods and civilizations. I have labeled this broadly historical and global phenomenon as 'polysecularity’, suitable for multidisciplinary investigation.

Religious Actions Speak Louder than Words: Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs) Predicts Theism and Non-theism,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,Michael Buhrmester,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A central claim of the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that pan-human cognitive mechanisms explain supernatural agent beliefs. This claim faces the challenge of accounting for nontheism. More precisely, if nearly all human beings possess the cognitive mechanisms outlined by CSR scholars, then how do we explain patterns in the presence of theists and non-theists? Evolutionary anthropologist Joseph Henrich has proposed the existence of a psychological bias focused on “Credibility Enhancing Displays” (CREDs). We are biased, Henrich argues, to believe the representations we receive from others to the extent that they 'walk the walk’ and not just 'talk the talk’. The implication for theism and non-theism is that individuals will be much less likely to acquire the theistic beliefs of their communities if they are not exposed to sufficient levels of CREDs. We will present new evidence from a diverse sample of Americans suggesting that CREDs exposure, as measured by our recently validated scale (alpha= .92), predicts theism vs. non-theism (B= .519, p< .01), all while controlling for religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for theism. They suggest that actions do indeed speak louder than words in convincing individuals of the reality of supernatural agents and that, to be successfully transmitted, religious commitments must be embodied.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"action,word,exposure,credibility,display,cred,theism,non,theism,claim,science,religion,csr,mechanism,agent,belief,claim,challenge,nontheism,being,mechanism,csr,scholar,pattern,presence,theist,non,theist,anthropologist,joseph,henrich,existence,bias,credibility,display,cred,henrich,representation,extent,walk,talk,implication,theism,non,theism,individual,belief,community,level,cred,evidence,sample,american,cred,exposure,scale,alpha=,theism,theism,socialization,result,significance,cred,theism,action,word,individual,reality,agent,commitment"
Navigating the Nonbeliever Constellation: What’s at Stake in Labeling Nonbelievers and Secular Activists?,Joseph Blankholm,Columbia University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent articles from J.M. Smith (2011, 2013), LeDrew (2013), Cimino and Smith (2007, 2011, 2012), and Guenther et al. (2013) point both directly and indirectly to the need for a dialogue on how to describe America’s “nonbelievers.” Cragun and Hammer (2011) have provided sage advice for avoiding tacit pro-religiosity, though much discussion remains. Namely, should scholars treat humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, naturalists, and non-theists as a single group, and how carefully should they attend to the particularities ascribed to these terms by those who adopt them? This paper relies on 65 in-depth interviews with the leaders and members of America’s major nonbeliever organizations in order to provide concrete examples of how leaders from various types of groups understand their own labels and those of others. Because there is no consensus among these leaders, I couch my analysis within their interorganizational politics, and I observe the ways in which they both emphasize and minimize differences among the terms depending on the context. I then look at how scholars in our burgeoning field have chosen to describe these various groups, with the aim of offering some tentative suggestions on how to attend to the differences between them while still making use of efficacious umbrella categories.

Exline,Case Western University,Ohio,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How do atheists and agnostics imagine that they would respond in two hypothetical situations: 1) being presented with clear evidence that a god actually did exist and 2) encountering this god, with a choice to approach, stand still, or move away? Adult participants (N = 520) from the U.S. completed an online survey via Amazon’s MTurk. Only those who endorsed nonbelief in any god on a screening question completed the survey. Results suggested that nonbelievers varied considerably in their imagined responses to god-focused evidence and encounters. On Likert items (consolidated through factor analysis), confusion was endorsed most, then fear, a loss of freedom, and positive emotion (these three did not differ), then anger, then guilt/ shame. An open-ended item revealed responses not tapped in the Likert items, including shock/surprise, continued skepticism, curiosity, awe, and decisions about whether to follow the god and whether/how to change one’s life and beliefs. In terms of the imagined encounter, most participants reported preferences to approach or stand still vs. moving away. In comparison to agnostics, atheists (especially “closed” atheists) imagined more negatively valenced responses (e.g., more anger, more loss of freedom, less positive emotion, less approach behavior, and more avoidance). In general, more positively valenced emotions and behaviors were associated with greater age, higher agreeableness and conscientiousness, lower neuroticism, more positive ratings of the (hypothetical) god’s attributes, more struggles involving religious doubts, less certainty about one’s nonbelief, fewer interpersonal struggles around religion, and fewer microaggressions related to one’s nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"evidence,existence,god,atheist,agnostic,atheist,agnostic,situation,evidence,god,god,choice,adult,participant,u.s,survey,amazon,mturk,nonbelief,god,screening,question,survey,result,nonbeliever,response,god,evidence,encounter,likert,item,factor,analysis,confusion,loss,freedom,emotion,anger,shame,item,response,likert,item,shock,surprise,skepticism,curiosity,awe,decision,god,life,belief,term,encounter,participant,preference,comparison,agnostic,atheist,atheist,response,anger,loss,freedom,emotion,approach,behavior,avoidance,emotion,behavior,age,agreeableness,neuroticism,rating,god,attribute,struggle,doubt,certainty,nonbelief,struggle,religion,microaggression,nonbelief"
Secular Students and Spirituality,Kathleen M. Goodman,Miami University,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within higher education and student affairs, it has become very common to provide programming related to “spirituality” of college students, based on the premise that everyone is spiritual. Using data from a national study of college student spirituality conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute, I will investigate to the extent to which the concepts of spirituality as defined in the study are applicable to secular students in the sample. The original study, conducted from 2003-2007 used principle components analysis to identify factors related to spirituality, religion, and related qualities (which they defined as charitable involvement, ethical involvement, etc.). A major conclusion from the study was that today’s college students have very high levels of spiritual interest and involvement. My study seeks to understand whether that holds true for secular students. Preliminary findings suggest that secular students score lower than the overall sample on measures of spirituality and religion, but they score only slightly lower on the related qualities measures. I conclude that many of the topics called “spirituality” are salient for secular students, however, the concept is not universally applicable. A practical implication based on these findings is that educators should begin with the broad concept of “Pathways to Purpose,” or “Purpose, Meaning, and Values” (rather than defining that as spirituality) to create a more inclusive environment. Framing programming in this way will broaden conversations so students can position themselves in the conversation in ways that are authentic to them, whether they are spiritual, religious, secular, or some combination.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"student,spirituality,education,student,affair,programming,spirituality,college,student,premise,datum,study,college,student,spirituality,education,research,institute,extent,concept,spirituality,study,student,sample,study,principle,component,analysis,factor,spirituality,religion,quality,involvement,involvement,etc,conclusion,study,today,college,student,level,interest,involvement,study,student,finding,student,sample,measure,spirituality,religion,quality,measure,topic,spirituality,student,concept,implication,finding,educator,concept,pathway,purpose,meaning,value,spirituality,environment,programming,way,conversation,student,conversation,way,combination"
Nonreligion and Religious Pluralism in Australia: A New Context for Christian Identity and Dialogue,Kevin Lenehan,Catholic Theological College,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"By all indicators, Australia is among the most nonreligious nations on earth, rated 10th by the WIN-Gallup 2012 Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. In this paper I will firstly outline religious/nonreligious identification in Australia on the basis of the 2011 national census data. A comparison with earlier data shows a steady decrease in identification with Christian churches other than Roman Catholicism, a small but steady increase in identification with religions other than Christianity, and a consistent increase in the number of Australians identifying as 'no religion’ (22.5% in 2011). In the second section of the paper, I will look beyond the statistics of institutional identification to explore social research into the beliefs and practices Australians use to make sense of life. This perspective calls for a more nuanced description of religious/nonreligious identity than data such as a national census can provide. In the Australian context, as well as intentional religious and nonreligious identification we find evidence of high levels of both 'believing without belonging’ and 'belonging without believing’, within a pragmatic cultural attitude of 'practical secularity’. This situation is reminiscent of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s analysis of his own 1940s European context, a 15 post-Christendom culture in which people lived and acted 'as though God does not exist’. In the third section of the paper, I will draw on Bonhoeffer’s challenging insights about what the Christian church can learn from the 'promising godlessness’ of its contemporaries to propose some characteristics of the kind of dialogue Christians are called to in Australia’s pluralistic context.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"nonreligion,pluralism,australia,context,identity,dialogue,indicator,australia,nation,earth,win,gallup,index,religiosity,atheism,paper,identification,australia,basis,census,datum,comparison,datum,decrease,identification,church,catholicism,increase,identification,religion,christianity,increase,number,australian,religion,section,paper,statistic,identification,research,belief,practice,australian,sense,life,perspective,description,identity,datum,census,context,identification,evidence,level,attitude,secularity,situation,dietrich,bonhoeffer,analysis,context,culture,people,god,section,paper,bonhoeffer,insight,church,godlessness,contemporary,characteristic,kind,dialogue,christian,australia,context"
How Christian Atheists Can Shed Light on Anti-Atheist Prejudice in America,Kyle Thompson,Claremont Graduate University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Anti-atheist prejudice in the United States is well documented in both academic studies and in news media yet its underlying causes are still not fully known. Since data suggests that atheists experience prejudice in different ways and for different reasons than other more prominent types of discrimination, such as racial prejudice, the process of understanding anti-atheist prejudice likely requires unique research and critical thinking. In this essay, I will explore possible explanations for anti-atheist prejudice based on the most comprehensive scientific examinations of atheists as well as propose that social scientists study Christian atheists, people who lack a belief in God but subscribe to the moral teachings of Jesus, to see if they experience the same degree of prejudice and stereotyping as other atheists. While sociological data indicates that much of the negative stereotyping surrounding atheism results from concerns about an atheist’s ability to behave morally, it is not clear precisely what causes this moral distrust since atheists tend to not only lack a belief in any supernatural moral scorekeeper, but also any universal and codified set of ethical norms such as those found in religious texts. Since Christian atheists affirm the set of ethical norms of Christianity while lacking a belief in God, it would be highly useful to investigate whether people hold the same stereotypical view of them as they do atheists who do not self-identity as Christian atheists.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"atheist,light,prejudice,america,prejudice,state,study,news,medium,cause,datum,atheist,prejudice,way,reason,type,discrimination,prejudice,process,prejudice,research,thinking,essay,explanation,prejudice,examination,atheist,scientist,atheist,people,belief,god,teaching,jesus,degree,prejudice,stereotyping,atheist,datum,stereotyping,atheism,concern,atheist,ability,distrust,atheist,belief,scorekeeper,set,norm,text,atheist,set,norm,christianity,belief,god,people,view,atheist,self,identity,atheist"

Jelen,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, we present three models of religion/regime relations. The “Quasi-Establishment” model describes nations with pluralistic religious markets, in which explicitly religious alternatives seek social and political advantages. Nations which embody the ancien regime model have a dominant religious tradition, which has been discredited through association with a previously undemocratic regime. Finally, National Identity regimes consist of nations in which a particular religious affiliation is a component of national identity, and in which this link has been defined by the actions of an outside power. We hypothesize that the correlations of religious non-affiliation will be different in each regime type. In religiously pluralistic societies, non-affiliation will largely be caused by individual characteristics, such as education and education. In nations that embody the ancient regime model, religious non-affiliation will be positively related to indicators of secular social integration, such as participation in voluntary associations, partisan identification, etc. Conversely, religious non-affiliation will be negatively related to social integration in national identity regimes.

Secular or Nonreligious? Profiling and Theorising European and US 'Religious Landscapes’,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In profiling religiosity, Europe and the US are almost always described as different: 'secular Europe’ and 'religious America’. This paper presents quantitative data that show that the secular population (i.e. the number of people who are more or less indifferent to religion) is consistent not only across European countries but is also of a similar scale in Europe and the US. On the other hand, the size of the active nonreligious population varies, between these countries and continents. Thus, secularity appears to be less significant for understanding differences between the European and US 'religious landscapes’ than active participation in religious and nonreligious cultures: several European countries appear to have vital nonreligious cultures with established histories, whilst this is an emerging phenomenon in the US.

In the Name of a Draconian Conception of State Neutrality’: Law’s Affirmation that You Can’t be Good without God,Lori Beaman,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The legal regulation of religion extends beyond categories of religion to the emerging category of nones. Most famously, the Lautsi decision in Italy highlighted the tensions that emerge between historically dominant religious hegemonies and those whose lives are not informed by religious worldviews. And yet, the European Court of Human Rights entertained the notion that dominant religion is not necessarily religion per se, but represents universal and cultural values which inform and indeed benefit all of society. Contrary to the argument of atheists that one can be good without god, legal discourse is shaping a new rhetoric of the foundational nature of religion to the common good, an idea that presses even those who do not 'believe’ to believe, or to at least accept the inherent value of god in the creation of a good society. The universal truth of religion becomes, then, inescapable and impossible to opt out of. This new legal rhetoric has increasing traction in a number of western democracies whose majoritarian religion would seem to be in decline. Law is coming to the rescue, carving out a new place for religion as fundamental to societal well-being and religious practices and symbols in state institutions are therefore an acceptable and even welcome presence.

Fazzino,University of Nevada,Nevada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Labeling atheists as immoral individuals, the very personification of evil, is not a particularly new idea. Attaining civic inclusion in a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, a city like Las Vegas where God is believed to be absent, would be easy. This is simply not the case. The strong cultural lore of “Sin City” promotes a false illusion that Las Vegas is a city where vice trumps virtue for sinners rather than saints. In this paper, I take a qualitative ethnographic approach that integrates participant observation, visual data, and in-depth interviews with textual analysis of local news stories. My goal is to understand how atheists have engaged in community building, activism, and collective boundary work in Las Vegas. My findings suggest that the moral landscape of Las Vegas very much a terrain of resistance where the interplay between religious and secular ideologies create a contested web of power and counter-power relations, indicating that even in Las Vegas where it is acceptable to be a sinner, heathens are persona non grata. I argue that the mobilization of collective action among the Las Vegas humanists and atheists community should be understood as dramaturgical performances of irreligious morality that both justifies the rejection of deviant labels and challenges the moral proclivity of American theists.

This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced 'irreligious socialisation’, rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12–18% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as 'unarticulated causes’ of the subjects’ irreligion.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.,"atheist,atheism,century,britain,atheism,population,characteristic,century,society,historian,study,remedy,omission,autobiography,history,atheist,atheisation,transition,belief,atheism,phenomenon,childhood,adolescence,source,age,reason,subject,irreligion,significance,third,religion,life,lack,engagement,religion,concept,ritual,background,socialisation,religion,progress,atheisation,trauma,criticism,religion,trauma,politic,rationalism,proportion,reason,source,influence,attitude,religion,childhood,experience,education,threat,event,revolution,1960,cause,subject,irreligion"

These so-called religious “nones” have caused some debate about the future of religion in the U.S. Are there any societal reasons for this increase? Does the rise of the religious nones indicate a decline of religious belief in the United States? Does this trend give validity to the secularization thesis? In this paper, I will first evaluate the reasons for the rise of the religious nones in light of considerations from José Casanova’s article, “Rethinking Secularization: A Global Comparative Perspective.” In dialogue with Casanova, I will compare the relationship between state/ church politics and the secularization of Europe with the relationship between state/politics politics and the rise of the nones in the United States. Next, I will consider the religious make-up of the religious nones with particular attention paid to the presence of any private spirituality among this group. Appropriating the work of Rodney Stark, I will consider whether the persistence of spirituality among the nones constitutes an effective rebuttal of the secularization thesis.

Secular Cooperation in England and the Americas,Michael Rectenwald,New York University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, I treat Secularism as founded by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851-52. In particular, I focus on the distinction that Holyoake maintained over the course of fifty years regarding his branch of Secularism, in the face of the broader, arguably more successful division of the movement led by Charles Bradlaugh. As distinct from Bradlaugh, for Holyoake the “secular” did not primarily signify the absence or negation of religious belief or practice. Rather, by the secular, Holyoake indicated a substantive category in its own right. Secularism itself represented a “positive” creed and movement intended to supersede or superintend both theism and atheism. Holyoake imagined and fostered the co-existence of secular and religious elements subsisting under a common umbrella. The secular and religious were figured as complementary and co-constituting aspects of what we might call, after Charles Taylor, an overarching “secularity,” but which Holyoake termed Secularism proper. Holyoake’s Secularism was not only at odds with the understanding of the Bradlaugh camp during his own lifetime but also it differs markedly from the standard secularization thesis as developed from the nineteenth century and beyond. This paper examines the movement that united atheists, skeptics, “agnostics,” and liberal theists, who might cooperate for the material improvement of humanity, especially the working classes, using Secularism as their creed. It particularly emphasizes Holyoake’s insistence on the cooperation among believers and unbelievers. It traces the movement to the Americas and examines the varieties of Secularism that came under Holyoake’s influence, or resisted it.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"cooperation,england,america,paper,secularism,george,jacob,holyoake,distinction,holyoake,course,year,branch,secularism,face,division,movement,charles,bradlaugh,bradlaugh,holyoake,absence,negation,belief,practice,holyoake,category,right,secularism,creed,movement,theism,atheism,holyoake,existence,element,umbrella,aspect,charles,taylor,secularity,holyoake,secularism,holyoake,secularism,odd,understanding,bradlaugh,camp,lifetime,secularization,thesis,century,paper,movement,atheist,skeptic,agnostic,theist,material,improvement,humanity,class,secularism,creed,holyoake,insistence,cooperation,believer,unbeliever,movement,america,variety,secularism,holyoake,influence"
On the Origin and Rise of Atheism,Mikko Sillfors,University of Helsinki,Finland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Theism has probably been the most influential belief in human history. However, atheism/naturalism can be traced back to ancient schools like Epicureanism and Cˉarvˉaka (India) and during the last 300 years atheism has gradually become fairly general in some countries. What is the origin of atheism? Why is it increasing? Based on dual-process theory and recent research on atheism a theoretical 'holistic’ hypothesis can be made. According to dual-process theory processes of human mind can be divided into intuitive (automatic, rapid, nonverbal, evolutionary old) and reflective (controlled, slow, linked to language, evolutionary recent). In holistic hypothesis three levels of factors are taken into account in explaining atheism/theism. 1) Biological level. Especially two universally evolved intuitive human cognitive traits — hyperactive agency detection device (HADD) and theory of mind (ToM) — have helped mankind to survive but have also made theism attractive. This partially explains why gods and supernatural beliefs have dominated the human history. 2) Psychological level. Those who are more prone to reflective processing or have deficiency of ToM seem to have a tendency towards atheism. This in part explains why scepticism/atheism is an ancient and universal phenomenon. 3) Sociocultural level. Certain (mostly modern) factors – like general wealth, security, modern environment, freedom of belief, education, secularization, and public visibility of atheism and natural/scientific explanations – seem to decline people’s motivation for religion and/or incline minds into reflective processing. From the viewpoint of holistic hypothesis, both theism and atheism are 'natural’ stances.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"origin,rise,atheism,theism,belief,history,atheism,naturalism,school,epicureanism,cˉarvˉaka,india,year,atheism,country,origin,atheism,process,theory,research,atheism,hypothesis,process,theory,process,mind,language,hypothesis,level,factor,account,atheism,theism,level,trait,agency,detection,device,hadd,theory,mind,tom,mankind,theism,god,belief,history,level,processing,deficiency,tom,tendency,atheism,scepticism,atheism,phenomenon,level,factor,wealth,security,environment,freedom,belief,education,secularization,visibility,atheism,explanation,people,motivation,religion,mind,processing,viewpoint,hypothesis,theism,atheism,stance"
The Collective Consciousness of Atheism,Mohammad Abdel Haq,"California State University, Fullerton",California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite a doctrine of separation of church and state, religion continues to play a significant role in American politics. Churches facilitate political participation through shared interests, resources, and motivation and religion plays a substantial role in shaping morality, as well as political views and attitudes. Weber argues that the “Protestant Ethic” dominates what is normative in the social and political sphere in the United States. In this study, we examine whether religion is in fact necessary for the creation of a collective moral and political framework or whether secular individuals such as atheists are also capable of sharing a collective consciousness. We do so by asking two questions; first, does a collective political framework exist among atheists? Second, if so, how do the political attitudes of atheists differ from the Protestant majority in regards to party affiliation? We explore these questions using a multinomial logistic regression approach, utilizing data from the 2008 Pew Research Center’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, a nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults. Our results suggest that atheists are very different demographically from Protestants in terms of region, gender, education level, and generation. However, after controlling for these differences, there are still substantial differences in political views and moral attitudes between Protestants and Atheists. We argue that these differences represent differing sets of shared beliefs and moral attitudes, or collective consciousness, between Protestants and Atheist, and are not simply the result of differences in other characteristics.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"consciousness,atheism,doctrine,separation,church,state,religion,role,politic,church,participation,interest,resource,motivation,religion,role,morality,view,attitude,weber,ethic,sphere,state,study,religion,fact,creation,framework,individual,atheist,consciousness,question,framework,atheist,attitude,atheist,majority,regard,party,affiliation,question,regression,approach,datum,pew,research,center,u.s,landscape,survey,sample,adult,result,atheist,protestant,term,region,gender,education,level,generation,difference,difference,view,attitude,protestant,atheist,difference,set,belief,attitude,consciousness,protestant,result,difference,characteristic"
Irreligious Death: Making Meaning without the Theist Crutch,Nicholas J. MacMurray,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Death is a universal experience, but the meanings and practices surrounding death vary according to cultural and temporal contexts. Examining how different groups approach end of life preparations, death practices, and grief management provides valuable insight into the varied meanings of death and the broader sociocultural context in which they exist. In the United States, death is often understood in the context of religion. As such, secular death practices and grief management is grossly understudied. This ethnographic study is an attempt to understand how individuals with an irreligious worldview handle the management of death within a hegemonic religious context where much of the language and practice surrounding death holds little meaning, and consequently, little value. Because irreligious individuals lack the social crutches provided by religion, they must find other means for confronting death and managing grief. Utilizing a “death acceptance” framework, we identity the unique challenges irreligious individuals face when reconciling the “death of self” and dealing with the “death of other” and outline various irreligious death practices and grief management strategies. We argue that the lack of institutionalized secular death culture increases the difficulty of managing death and grief, but ultimately reinforces an irreligious death acceptance perspective. By focusing inquiry on irreligious understandings, negotiations, and practices surrounding death and the ways in which these contrast with normative social practices at large, this study highlights the need for establishing a more inclusive death culture and contributes to the scholarship on the lived experience of irreligion in the United States today.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"death,meaning,theist,crutch,death,experience,meaning,practice,death,context,group,end,life,preparation,death,practice,grief,management,insight,meaning,death,context,state,death,context,religion,death,practice,grief,management,study,attempt,individual,worldview,management,death,context,language,death,meaning,value,individual,crutch,religion,mean,death,grief,death,acceptance,framework,challenge,individual,death,self,death,death,practice,grief,management,strategy,lack,death,culture,difficulty,death,grief,death,acceptance,perspective,inquiry,understanding,negotiation,practice,death,way,contrast,practice,study,need,death,culture,scholarship,experience,irreligion,state,today"
Atheists Still Others?

Michele Lamont has argued that moral worthiness is an important form of social capital in the United States, and religiosity has served as a kind of proxy for this social capital in both private and public life (e.g. for being a good neighbor, or a good citizen). Religion serves as a basis for cultural membership in American life, and a stated rejection of religion (e.g. the affirmation of an atheist identity) serves to define and sharpen a key symbolic boundary that separates authentic/good/true citizens from inauthentic/ problematic ones. In the spring of 2014, a 10-year follow-up survey was fielded by the Boundaries in the American Mosaic project team. In this paper, I compare the findings on religious outsiders in 2014 with those from 2003. Attitudes towards atheists have not changed appreciably in that ten-year time frame, despite the rising percentage and visibility of those claiming no religious identity (the “nones”). In this analysis, I first compare the determinants of atheist distrust in 2003 and 2014 with a special focus on the intersection of age and religiosity. Second, I compare the determinants of atheist distrust with those factors predicting distrust of other small religious out-groups (Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons).

The Pope and the “Nones”: Pope Francis and the New Age of Atheism,Peter F. Huff,Centenary College of Louisiana,Louisiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The Catholic church’s Second Vatican Council (1962-65) identified atheism as “one of the most serious problems of our time.” The council’s landmark document, The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, called for “sincere and prudent” dialogue with unbelievers in the age of secularism. Pope Paul VI (1963-78) endorsed dialogue with atheists in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam and established an unprecedented Vatican department to oversee the dialogue: the Secretariat for Non-Believers. He also commissioned the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to make the study of atheism a priority for the priestly order’s intellectual apostolate. A half century after the council, however, Catholic-atheist dialogue remains part of Vatican II’s unfinished agenda. The 2013 papal election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio has sparked new interest in dialogue between believers and unbelievers. A “Francis Effect” has been observed in various areas of ecclesial and social life—from curial reform in the Vatican to public discourse on social justice and gay marriage. This paper investigates the impact of Pope Francis on the relationship of the church to non-believers, especially the “nones” rapidly reshaping contemporary religious experience. The paper traces the development of Francis’ understanding of the phenomenon of modern unbelief from his writings as Jesuit educator and Archbishop of Buenos Aires to his principal papal messages: his encyclical Lumen Fidei, his apostolic letter Evangelii Gaudium, his 2014 World Day of Peace message, and his controversial interviews in La Repubblica and La Civiltà Cattolica.

A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives. There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting. However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships. This availability sample collects, in addition to demographics, information on how nones find romantic partners, the demographics of whom nones get involved with romantically, and the quality and duration of relationships. The impact on well-being of not being affiliated with a religion on romantic relationships will also be presented, using both quantitative and qualitative data.

“Splitters!”: Lessons from Monty Python for Nontheist/ Freethought Organizations in the US,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the 19th century saw a wave of popularity for freethinkers in the US, much of this excitement had died down by the early part of the 20th century. Just a handful of nontheist and freethought organizations remained, and most of them were very small and on the verge of collapsing. However, starting in 1941 with the founding of the American Humanist Association and followed by the founding of American Atheists in 1963, the number of nontheist organizations experienced a slow increase. Today, there are several large, national, member-based nontheist/freethought social movement organizations in the US and thousands of smaller, local organizations. In this paper we examine the origins and inter-relations of four of the largest nontheist/freethought organizations in the US: the American Humanist Association, American Atheists, the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. In examining the origins of these organizations, we draw upon several social movement theories but also extend current theorizing by discussing the importance of inter-personal relationships for understanding how social movement organizations “split” or “fracture”. We also discuss whether these “splits” facilitate or hinder the aims of the broader movement in the US.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"splitter,lesson,monty,python,freethought,organization,century,wave,popularity,freethinker,excitement,century,handful,nontheist,freethought,organization,verge,founding,association,founding,atheist,number,organization,increase,today,member,nontheist,freethought,movement,organization,thousand,organization,paper,origin,relation,nontheist,freethought,organization,association,atheist,council,humanism,freedom,religion,foundation,origin,organization,movement,theory,theorizing,importance,relationship,movement,organization,fracture,split,facilitate,aim,movement"
Universalized – Classical- Secularization Theory,Volkan Ertit,Radbound University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The classical theory of secularization remains one of the most controversial in the field of social science. According to the theory, modernization is the main reason behind the aggressive secularization process now pervading Europe. There are two main issues of discussion among respected sociologists and theologists in this regard. First, there is an ongoing debate on the meaning of the theory, especially among American and European scholars, in which they have yet to find consensus regarding the answers to the questions, “what does the theory assert?” and “what does it not assert?” The second discussion, which cannot be considered separately from the first one, is whether the theory is able to put forward a clear explanation for the bumpy relationship between religion and society in the European context and other parts of the world. In my paper, I will attempt to provide some answers to the two questions mentioned above. Firstly, I will try to shed some light on what the classical secularization theory asserts and does not assert. Then, in a clear departure from more well-known theorists like Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson, I will argue that the theory is not only valid for European societies but for every society at large. To make the theory universal in its relevance, the old classical secularization paradigm needs to be slightly revised. In attempting this, aspects of the old paradigm that belong to the history of Europe and its offshoots (Protestan Reformation) will be somewhat downplayed while those with more universal relevance (scientific advances, urbanization and industrial capitalism) will be highlighted.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.,"secularization,theory,theory,secularization,field,science,theory,modernization,reason,secularization,process,europe,issue,discussion,sociologist,theologist,regard,debate,meaning,theory,scholar,consensus,answer,question,theory,discussion,theory,explanation,relationship,religion,society,context,part,world,paper,answer,question,light,secularization,theory,departure,theorist,steve,bruce,bryan,wilson,theory,society,society,theory,relevance,secularization,paradigm,aspect,paradigm,history,europe,offshoot,reformation,relevance,advance,urbanization,capitalism"

True, Harris’ philosophical conclusions regarding meditation are dubious at times, and his advice to spiritual neophytes is disappointing, but that doesn’t diminish the effectiveness of this work to serve as a clear wake up call to the secular world. It’s time more secularists realized that the religious do not have a monopoly on spirituality; there’s no reason why the secular world can’t access it too.","sam,harris,spotlight,possibility,spirituality,post,kyle,thompson,sam,harris,book,thompson,harris,argument,spirituality,nonreligion,departure,atheist,perspective,thompson,shift,discourse,researcher,nonreligion,note,end,harris,work,ground,attention,benefit,practice,crystal,prose,dogma,life,awareness,moment,harris,conclusion,meditation,time,advice,neophyte,effectiveness,work,wake,world,time,secularist,monopoly,spirituality,reason,world"

In this article, she considers the question: ‘What do atheists do at Christmas?’ Drawing on interviews with her London based atheist participants, Katherine argues that their Christmases are far from meaningless without the ‘Christ’, showing instead that they are linked with family relationships and a sense of personal identity.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Writing in 1971, Colin Campbell noted that the nonreligious were often depicted as ‘loners’. (Campbell 2013). Interviewing nonreligious people for this article, it was clear to me that, although they celebrate Christmas in different ways, they all plan their celebrations with reference to a web of social relations. They consider, accommodate, and negotiate the expectations of family, friends, colleagues, and wider society. Sonia delayed her decision to stop giving Christmas presents because she was nervous about the impact that decision would have on her social life – her ties to her family and to her nephew in particular. Kathleen’s enthusiasm about her Christmas tree is not a symptom of individualism or materialism, and does not contradict her statement that ‘Christmas is about family’. When she speaks of ‘connections to the past’ and ‘lots of lost memories’, it is clear that the lost decorations were important to her because they represented some of her most significant social relationships – to her mother, grandmother and daughter. Theorists across a range of disciplines have acknowledged that social identity is multifaceted: gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, religion are just some elements that might comprise one person’s identity. Social identity is also situational – as an individual moves between social settings, different aspects of their identity may feel more important than others. Perhaps some people expect the Christmas activities of the nonreligious to differ radically from those of Christians. In doing so, they assume that a person’s position with regard to religion should override other aspects of their identity in determining their Christmas practices. In fact, other aspects of identity also influence the ways in which nonreligious people celebrate. Sonia’s family acknowledge their genealogical and cultural ties to the Caribbean with the food that they eat. Rita described her Latvian celebrations with great enthusiasm, but only talked about her lack of religious belief when prompted. Perhaps for Rita, her Latvian heritage is more salient than her ‘atheism-slash-humanism’ at Christmas time.","christmas,religion,katherine,sisson,season,year,dust,january,katherine,sisson,look,christmas,article,question,atheist,christmas,interview,london,participant,katherine,christmas,christ,family,relationship,sense,identity,colin,campbell,loner,campbell,people,article,christmas,way,celebration,reference,web,relation,expectation,family,friend,colleague,society,sonia,decision,christmas,present,impact,decision,life,tie,family,nephew,kathleen,enthusiasm,christmas,tree,symptom,individualism,materialism,statement,christmas,family,connection,past,lot,memory,decoration,relationship,mother,grandmother,daughter,theorist,range,discipline,identity,gender,nationality,ethnicity,sexuality,religion,element,person,identity,identity,move,setting,aspect,identity,people,christmas,activity,christian,person,position,regard,religion,aspect,identity,christmas,practice,fact,aspect,identity,way,people,sonia,family,tie,caribbean,food,rita,celebration,enthusiasm,lack,belief,rita,heritage,atheism,slash,humanism,christmas,time"

Quillen,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Ethan Quillen explores a discursive approach to atheism (and nonreligion) following the theoretical work of von Stuckrad (2003). Quillen suggests that researchers in this area move away from definitions and wrangling over the the meaning of words, and concentrate instead on the way in which these words are used; how these words are made meaningful and allowing research participants to ‘speak for themselves’. Here, Quillen proposes that this discursive approach has methodological implications for research in this field.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"During this methodological review I came across von Stuckrad’s (2003, 2010, 2013) discussion of the benefits of a ‘discourse analysis’ in the study of religion, and many of the issues addressed in his work seemed aptly comparable to my own. That is, given the predicament of defining religion, his discursive approach seemed to obviate the ‘need’ to define terminology at all, favoring instead an analysis of the process with which individuals use terms like ‘religion’—or ‘Atheism’—in the development of identity construction. In essence, a discursive analysis is an examination of the way in which a particular use of language is generated, employed, and observed. In this way, the term ‘Atheism’ can be approached the same way as the term ‘religion,’ an ‘empty signifier’ (von Stuckrad 2003: 166) that is then filled with meaning depending on the language used. No longer does this require a ‘definition.’ Now, we can perceive how ‘language in use’ (van Dijk 1997; Fairclough 2003; Gee 2005; Paltridge 2006) provides meaning to the term within particular contexts. In many ways, this discursive approach seems quasi-anthropological in its allowing one’s informants to ‘speak for themselves.’ For my intentions, ‘using’ Atheism in this way, worked quite nicely. From this analysis I was able to create a processual understanding, a foundational interpretation less like a definition, and more an appreciation, about how the Atheists within my data discursively use the term in relation to the scholarly discourse defining it. This methodology, in different ways, has allotted me the freedom from constructing yet another definition, and subsequently both removed my analysis from the ambiguous nature inherent in defining the term, as well as reinforced the ethnographic nature of my intentions. More specifically, though, it has permitted the opportunity to perceive Atheism as a visible or ‘expressed’ identity (von Stuckrad 2003: 263) that, in the coming years, I hope to further explore through data such as fiction, film, art, court decisions, and within immeasurable other discursive fields.","discourse,analysis,study,atheism,definition,discourse,criticism,post,ethan,approach,atheism,nonreligion,work,von,stuckrad,quillen,researcher,area,definition,meaning,word,way,word,word,research,participant,approach,implication,research,field,review,von,stuckrad,discussion,benefit,discourse,analysis,study,religion,issue,work,predicament,religion,approach,need,terminology,analysis,process,individual,term,religion’—or,atheism’—in,development,identity,construction,essence,analysis,examination,way,use,language,way,term,atheism,way,term,religion,signifier,von,stuckrad,meaning,language,definition,language,use,van,dijk,fairclough,gee,paltridge,meaning,term,context,way,approach,informant,intention,atheism,way,analysis,understanding,interpretation,definition,appreciation,atheist,datum,term,relation,discourse,methodology,way,freedom,definition,analysis,nature,term,nature,intention,opportunity,atheism,identity,von,stuckrad,year,datum,fiction,film,art,court,decision,field"

Furthermore, religious rejection is an element of the deconversion typology which certainly reflects the way people position themselves in opposition (or difference) to their abandoned religion.

What Religion is your Baby?,Katherine Sissons,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,In this post Katherine Sissons reflects on the Census 2011. She discusses the statistically significant relationship between gender and reliosity in female and male babies and young children (aged 0-4). What impact might this have for understanding the ‘nones’ and the way that the gender balance of adult religiosity and non-religiosity has on the next generation?,2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The 2001 Census for England and Wales was only the second census in Great Britain to include a question about religion (the first was in 1851). Analysing the data from the 2001 Census, sociologists found that baby girls were more likely than baby boys to be ‘Christian’(Voas & McAndrew 2012). Does this pattern persist in the 2011 Census? Voas and McAndrew suggest that the religion assigned to a young child is influenced by the religion of the child’s parents. They suggest that in a family where both parents are Christian, male and female children are likely to be identified as Christian. Likewise, in a family where both parents select “no religion”, both male and female children are likely to be assigned “no religion”. However, when the parents have different religions, children tend to be assigned the religion of the same-sex parent. Of course, this raises yet another question: why are men more likely than women to say that they have “no religion”? This phenomenon is not confined to Britain but has been identified in numerous other surveys (Hayes 2000). Some researchers have looked to evolution to explain these sex differences (Norenzayan et al. 2012), whilst others favour more social or cultural explanations (Trzebiatowska & Bruce 2012). Without a consensus on this issue, the puzzle of why young boys are more “non-religious” than young girls remains, at present, only partially solved.","religion,baby,post,katherine,sissons,census,relationship,gender,reliosity,baby,child,impact,none,way,gender,balance,adult,religiosity,religiosity,generation,census,england,wale,census,britain,question,religion,datum,census,sociologist,baby,girl,baby,boy,christian’(voas,mcandrew,pattern,census,voa,mcandrew,religion,child,religion,child,parent,family,parent,child,family,parent,religion,child,religion,parent,religion,child,religion,sex,parent,course,question,man,woman,religion,phenomenon,britain,survey,hayes,researcher,evolution,sex,difference,norenzayan,explanation,trzebiatowska,bruce,consensus,issue,puzzle,boy,girl"

But I wish to argue in this article that through the study of the nonreligious and their relationship towards religion, we can also gain a new understanding of religion itself. If we look at common definitions of religion, they typically frame our understanding of religion through its meaning for the religious alone. What religion might mean for the nonreligious – or for the “rest” of society – is not included, and remains a blind spot in the understanding of religion. But in societies with strong religious populations or governments, religion influences many areas of public and private life. Religion creates power relationships, especially when it is implemented in political processes or when majorities stand against minorities, be they religious or nonreligious. I refer to this as religious normation, and I’ll illustrate what I mean by this with some remarks about the United States. This requires a new definition of religion that encompasses these complexities. Therefore I propose a definition of religion as a cultural set of beliefs, norms, and practices with reference to a transcendent being or principle, which is held by parts of a society and may be applied particularly or universally through positive or negative sanctions, and whose bindingness depends on religion’s influence on the respective group.","spot,study,religion,post,petra,klug,question,definition,religion,light,focus,understanding,population,year,deal,information,non-,irreligion,article,study,relationship,religion,understanding,religion,definition,religion,understanding,religion,meaning,religion,rest,society,spot,understanding,religion,society,population,government,religion,area,life,religion,power,relationship,process,majority,minority,normation,remark,state,definition,religion,complexity,definition,religion,set,belief,norm,practice,reference,principle,part,society,sanction,bindingness,religion,influence,group"

Men tend to be the public faces of religious communities, but women participate more actively in religious activities, they pray more, and overall, religion plays a larger role in their lives. In addition, women rarely identify as atheists (Mahlamäki 2012: 60-61). Recently, this was seen in a study published by the UCL Institute of Education. The study showed that whereas 54% of British men born in 1970 identify as atheists, the figure among women is only 34% (Voas 2015). For a historian of non-religion, these results sound anything but new. The difference in religiosity between the genders had already been acknowledged by both the religious majority and the non-believers themselves 200 years ago. Here I reflect on the theme of gender and irreligiosity in the context of the 19th century United States, which is also the focus of my on-going PhD dissertation. Through looking at the ‘lived non-belief’ of these women, it might also be possible to shed light on the nature of female non-belief. In addition to women being statistically more religious, their religiousness and irreligiousness seems to be different from that of men. For example, studies have suggested that compared to men, women are more eclectic and more tolerant to contradiction in their beliefs (Mahlamäki 2012, p. 60-61). Though finding the voices of these women is a challenging task, especially those who were not part of any organised movements, it is indeed a task worth taking on.","sex,history,woman,religion,suvi,karila,root,intersection,womanhood,non,religion,context,century,state,karila,experience,woman,present,past,issue,religion,phenomenon,time,study,woman,man,trzebiatowska,bruce,man,face,community,woman,activity,religion,role,life,addition,woman,atheist,mahlamäki,study,ucl,institute,education,study,man,atheist,figure,woman,voas,historian,religion,result,difference,religiosity,gender,majority,non,believer,year,theme,gender,irreligiosity,context,century,state,focus,phd,dissertation,belief,woman,light,nature,non,belief,addition,woman,religiousness,irreligiousness,man,example,study,man,woman,contradiction,belief,mahlamäki,voice,woman,task,movement,task"

It also failed to reflect accurately the tangled histories of secular ideas, political settlements, and ways of living in the west and the Arab Middle East, shaped by centuries of interaction, including empire and migration. The so-called ‘War on Terror’ was an important chapter in these tangled histories. War is always a social and cultural encounter between sides.

What can a lack of interest in a Japanese SA tell us about the SA framework and/or the Japanese relationship to organised religion? ",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"God-less congregations, also known as members of the Sunday Assembly (SA), have been a recurring topic on this blog. Discussions around the SA have raised a number of meaningful questions over any strict distinction between religion and non-religion. This post, however, takes a slightly different approach, by exploring what difficulties the SA might face when they attempt to expand their movement outside the post-Christendom west. How do the SA attempt to address any challenges they face during expansion and indeed if they are interested in overcoming such difficulties? These questions follow an attempt to participate in a launch event for SA in Japan. As it turned out, the launch was a ‘non-event’. In the face of the usual positive, success story of the SA this ‘non-event’ seemed to offer the possibility of reflection on failure, and some raised new questions about the SA. Ironically, comparison with the Japanese context helps bring our attention to how the SA is operated within a western (or Christian) framework both in motivation and style. In Shusaku Endo’s novel Silence, a Jesuit missionary, who was sent to 17th century Japan, described Japan as a “mud swamp”, to express the difficulties he faced as a missionary. Here, Christianity seemed to grow but died soon after because the wet ground putrefied the roots. If ministers uttered similar laments about Japan today, it would not be surprising. The question remains if the SA will have to face similar challenges in their attempts to expand their group in a country such as Japan where there is no shared framework with their mission. Just like Christian missionaries today, does the SA have to struggle with contextualising their own ideology?","report,sunday,assembly,event,japan,post,yutaka,osakabe,isaac,gagné,absence,sunday,assembly,japan,interest,lack,interest,framework,relationship,religion,god,congregation,member,sunday,assembly,topic,blog,discussion,number,question,distinction,religion,religion,post,approach,difficulty,movement,west,attempt,challenge,expansion,difficulty,question,attempt,launch,event,japan,launch,event,face,success,story,event,possibility,reflection,failure,question,comparison,context,attention,framework,motivation,style,shusaku,endo,silence,missionary,century,japan,japan,mud,swamp,difficulty,missionary,christianity,ground,root,minister,lament,japan,today,question,challenge,attempt,group,country,japan,framework,mission,missionary,today,ideology"

My interest here is with religious nones, who comprise 24% of the Canadian adult population (Statistics Canada 2013) and 32% of Canadian teens (Bibby 2011, 51). Drawing on thirty interviews with religious nones, what are the perceived benefits for identifying as a religious none? What are their beliefs about the supernatural, about meaning and purpose in life as well as the afterlife, about morality, and their aversion to religion that is forced on to others? The findings below build on observations from other NSRN blogs on a range of beliefs held by those with no religion, particularly Gleb Tsipursky’s article “Meaning and Purpose in Non-Religious Societies.” Three brief conclusions stand out. First, religious nones are heterogeneous in the beliefs that they adopt. Second, religious nones are content with their life and their worldview – they do not think they are missing anything because they do not identify with a religion. Third, religious nones (in Canada at least) hold strongly to the position that religious or irreligious perspectives should not be forced on to others.

Based on the idea that a militant, aggressive and intolerant form of secularism is trying to marginalise faith and drive it out of the public square, anti-secular rhetoric has found growing popularity among political as well as religious figures (particularly those associated with the Christian faith) aiming to promote a greater role for faith in the public realm. The interests and motives behind the new anti-secularism, however, are substantively divergent, and the prospects of success are slim. For religious actors the main concerns centre on the progressive impact of secularization and the on-going decline of religious influence in British society and culture. In this case the use of anti-secular discourse forms part of a broader strategic move towards a form of identity politics based on a language of minority rights and demands for religious freedom. The promotion of anti-secular discourse by political actors is driven by a markedly different set of concerns.

The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or lifecycle rituals conducted under its auspices. According to my original survey, interview, and participant observation data, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them typically self-describe as non-religious, usually as spiritual, seekers, humanist, or generically “not religious.” Similarly, they describe their weddings in “non-religious” terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most “religious” language. These “secular” or “spiritual” wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. This article explains why “secular” people select ULC ministers for their weddings, how ULC ministers see themselves as “non-religious” while being members of a legally-recognized religion, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies.

This study employs a mixed-methods approach that includes in-depth interviews (n = 19), participant observation, and one survey administered to two atheist groups, one local (n = 151) and one national (n = 456). Ethnographic findings confirm the central role of stigma, identity, and community in atheist experience and emphasize their nestedness in one another. Survey results find that atheist affiliates in both national and local groups rate political activism as more important than social reasons in motivating them to affiliate, while local affiliates rated social reasons significantly higher than national affiliates rated social reasons. Suggestions for future research include consideration of these themes’ connectedness in subsequent analyses and further inquiry into the functional divergences between local and national atheist organizations.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.,"triangle,atheist,stigma,identity,community,atheist,north,carolina,triangle,region,study,atheism,theme,stigma,identity,community,date,study,approach,theme,field,utility,relation,experience,study,method,approach,depth,interview,participant,observation,survey,group,finding,role,stigma,identity,community,experience,nestedness,survey,result,affiliate,group,activism,reason,affiliate,affiliate,reason,affiliate,reason,suggestion,research,consideration,theme,connectedness,analysis,inquiry,divergence,organization"

Consistent with previous research, participants viewed moral transgressions as more representative of atheists than of Christians.

Creating Data about Nonreligious Belief,Abby Day,Goldsmiths College,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Abby Day is a leading sociologist of 'belief’. Here, she sets out what working with 'belief’ as a significant category of self-understanding can achieve, for religious 'unbelievers’ as much as for 'believers’. She encourages the use of analytical tools that respond to the complexity and multidimensionality of belief, and introduces her own seven-point method as one such approach.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In this blog I will outline two main methodological issues that are raised when researching belief, and how nonreligion may spill out of the data being created. One of the most common mistakes researchers in human sciences make, using qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods, is to state that 'the data’ are saying something. Data say nothing. The researcher says it all through the subjective experience of conducting research; and all research in human sciences is subjective from the moment the research question is formed, through the research design, to the questions being asked and the conclusions drawn. Methodologically, realising that data don’t 'speak’ – or, at least, that they are part of a broader conversation in which the researcher has played a determining role – is important because it creates a constant state of tension, uncertainty and, ideally, reflexivity in the researcher. For the study of nonreligious belief, this realisation can also free researchers from the strictures of preconceived concepts of what 'unbelief’ entails, whilst still allowing us to work with those concepts constructively instead of discarding them altogether.","datum,belief,abby,day,sociologist,belief,belief,category,self,understanding,unbeliever,believer,use,tool,complexity,belief,point,method,approach,blog,issue,belief,nonreligion,datum,mistake,researcher,science,method,datum,datum,researcher,experience,research,research,science,moment,research,question,research,design,question,conclusion,datum,conversation,researcher,role,state,tension,uncertainty,reflexivity,researcher,study,belief,realisation,researcher,stricture,concept,unbelief,entail,concept"
Understanding Unbelief – project launch,Lois Lee,University of Kent,England,F,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,Miguel Farias,Coventry University,England,M,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This plenary session introduces the Understanding Unbelief project, a major new research initiative in the study of nonreligion. This session will introduce the project and the opportunities it aims to provide researchers of atheism and other forms of unbelief and nonreligion around the world. It will also introduce methodological resources newly available for researchers working in these areas. The growth of atheism and other forms of ‘unbelief’ in many parts of the world is attracting increasingly wide attention, with many commentators attempting to address the causes of ‘unbelief’ and its effects on a range of outcomes such as personal well-being and social cohesion. Yet significant questions remain about how to understand such phenomena, and researchers and commentators still often rely on categories developed by social actors (e.g. atheism, unbelief, agnosticism, etc.) rather than social scientists. If we are to advance our scientific understanding in these areas, we need to account for the diverse psychological and social phenomena and processes subsumed under such broad terms as atheism and unbelief. We do not currently know how best to characterize the various forms of unbelief as psychological and sociological phenomena, the extent to which other beliefs – existential beliefs, or beliefs about religion, etc. – underpin these forms, how diverse they are, and how they vary across demographic groups and cultures. Yet understanding the nature and variety of unbelief is necessary if we are, in the future, to adequately answer enduring questions about the causes of ‘unbelief’ and its effects on wellbeing cohesion. With generous backing from the John Templeton Foundation, the Understanding Unbelief project aims to be the first major scientific research program to address the nature and variety of unbelief. It is designed to include (i) substantial grant competitions to generate multidisciplinary research into diverse forms of unbelief across demographic groups and cultural settings, and (ii) core interdisciplinary research working across these forms, groups, and settings to build a more integrated understanding of unbelief. Moreover, the project aims to provide a range of methodological and conceptual resources for researchers and applicants, including a flourishing multidisciplinary blog on methods for investigating unbelief, state of the art literature reviews, seminar series, and a new Oxford Dictionary of Atheism (OUP, 2016).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"unbelief,project,launch,session,unbelief,project,research,initiative,study,nonreligion,session,project,opportunity,researcher,atheism,form,unbelief,nonreligion,world,resource,researcher,area,growth,atheism,form,unbelief,part,world,attention,commentator,cause,unbelief,effect,range,outcome,cohesion,question,phenomenon,researcher,commentator,category,actor,e.g.,atheism,unbelief,agnosticism,etc,scientist,understanding,area,phenomenon,process,term,atheism,unbelief,form,unbelief,phenomenon,extent,belief,belief,belief,religion,etc,form,group,culture,nature,variety,unbelief,future,question,cause,unbelief,effect,wellbeing,cohesion,backing,john,templeton,foundation,unbelief,project,research,program,nature,variety,unbelief,grant,competition,research,form,unbelief,group,setting,core,research,form,group,understanding,unbelief,project,range,resource,researcher,applicant,blog,method,unbelief,state,art,literature,review,seminar,series,oxford,dictionary,atheism,oup"

As part of our “closing conference” and the annual NSRN conference we present selected conceptual and empirical findings. Our research focuses on four countries with quite distinct social, political, cultural and religious contexts: the Netherlands, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. In all of them, the differentiation from religion, while at the same time being related to respective religious phenomena, played a decisive role for nonreligious actors and their identity construction as well as their social and political activism. Based on the work in our project, we will firstly present our conceptual framework for researching nonreligion relationally, which is inspired by sociological field theory (e.g. Bourdieu). Secondly, we will describe and discuss some of our main research findings based on our empirical case studies in three countries (the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Philippines). In the context of a changing religious field, as well as a changing nonreligious constituency, Swedish humanists are engaged in a struggle about the adequate way of relating to, or disentangling from religion. In the Philippines, in relation to a politicized opposition to the “hegemony” of the Catholic Church and a gradual integration into global nonreligious networks, freethinkers and atheists are constantly negotiating their respective forms of “collective nonreligiosity”. Taking a slightly different angle, the third case study focuses on the struggles of a social-liberal party in the Netherlands for disentangling politics from religion, thereby also having to engage with questions of what nonreligious politics would be based on. We will outline such different relational assemblages, which give insights into the conjunction of these nonreligious groups’ relationships to actors whom they regard as the “religious” as well as those whom they perceive to be their “nonreligious others”.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"diversity,nonreligion,entanglement,netherland,sweden,philippine,research,project,diversity,nonreligion,research,council,dfg,closing,conference,conference,finding,research,country,context,netherland,india,sweden,philippine,differentiation,religion,time,phenomenon,role,actor,identity,construction,activism,work,project,framework,nonreligion,field,theory,bourdieu,research,finding,case,study,country,netherland,sweden,philippine,context,field,constituency,humanist,struggle,way,religion,philippine,relation,opposition,hegemony,church,integration,network,freethinker,atheist,form,nonreligiosity,angle,case,study,struggle,party,netherland,politic,religion,question,politic,assemblage,insight,conjunction,group,relationship,actor"
Pathways to Organizational Involvement Among Nonbelievers,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research on non-religion has often sampled for nonbelievers via their connections to nonreligious organizations. Making assumptions about nonbelievers as a whole, then, can problematic, since only a portion of nonbelievers are likely to be involved with such groups. Joining a nonreligious organization satisfies a desire for community for some nonbelievers, but social research has not adequately explained why some nonbelievers join while others do not. If nonbelievers are looking for social interaction, intellectual debate, or secular spiritual fulfillment, they can potentially find it via a nonreligious organization; however, organizational affiliation could be a sufficient but unnecessary means of achieving personal goals. This prompts me to ask, what is the difference between the joining and the non-joining nonbeliever? Have they taken different pathways to non-belief and do they experience nonbelief in significantly different ways? In order to determine why some nonbelievers choose not to participate in collective action, and to assess the actual impact of organizations on those who do, non-joiners should be compared to organization members, who may differ systematically from those who join. To answer these questions I interviewed 125 nonbelievers in Houston, Texas, most of whom were involved to varying degrees with nonreligious organizations, but many that were not. I examined respondents’ religious backgrounds, journeys to non-belief, “coming out” experiences, and organizational affiliations to search for similarities and differences in these two groups of nonbelievers.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"pathway,involvement,nonbeliever,research,religion,nonbeliever,connection,organization,assumption,nonbeliever,portion,nonbeliever,group,organization,desire,community,nonbeliever,research,nonbeliever,nonbeliever,interaction,debate,fulfillment,organization,affiliation,mean,goal,difference,joining,nonbeliever,pathway,belief,nonbelief,way,order,nonbeliever,action,impact,organization,non,joiner,organization,member,question,nonbeliever,houston,texas,degree,organization,respondent,background,journey,belief,experience,affiliation,similarity,difference,group,nonbeliever"
On the Virtues of a Meaning Systems Framework for Studying Nonreligious and Religious Worldviews in the Context of Everyday Life,Ann Taves,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Opening the new monthly issue of the [SSNB]-NSRN [methods blog series], Ann Taves explores one of the central questions in contemporary nonreligious studies – and a long-standing religious studies, too: how to understand and describe the object of study.

The MS framework, which was designed to encompass both religious and nonreligious meaning systems, allows us to conceptualize our object of study in generic terms. It offers a dynamic framework that has already generated a body of empirical research on the interaction between meaning systems (implicit and explicit) and meaning making in particular situations. Although much of this research has focused on how people cope with trauma, psychologists have extended it to other contexts, including conversion and spiritual transformation. Here I suggest we can build on the framework’s basic distinction between global meaning systems (GMS) and situational meaning (SM) by elaborating the concept of GMS in light of the literature on worldviews and the concept of SM in light of 'situational’ elements, such as practices, networks, institutions, and ways of life, that are typically studied by scholars of religion under the rubric of 'lived religion.’","virtue,meaning,system,framework,worldview,context,life,issue,ssnb]-nsrn,method,blog,series,ann,tave,question,study,study,object,study,overview,proposition,psychology,sociology,anthropology,proposal,meaning,system,approach,blog,post,challenge,nonreligion,secularity,scholar,religion,object,study,suggestion,job,range,thing,meaning,system,framework,use,psychology,purpose,framework,meaning,system,object,study,term,framework,body,research,interaction,system,making,situation,research,people,trauma,psychologist,context,conversion,transformation,framework,distinction,meaning,system,gms,meaning,concept,gms,light,literature,worldview,concept,light,element,practice,network,institution,way,life,scholar,religion,rubric,religion"
Researching the nonreligious in a secular society,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. The visibility of religion in society is low and nonreligiosity is considered normative. Estonians are also one of the nations (along with Czechs) in Europe who’s national identity is associated with atheism, in both cases expressed as “the most atheistic country in the world”. Nevertheless, different beliefs and practices associated with New Spirituality and indigenous Earth belief are very common. Thus, secularity in this context refers mostly to distance from conventional, theistic religion. The paper draws on the data from recent quantitative survey “On Life, Religion, and Religious Life” (2015). Among other questions, the survey offered participants two different possibilities for (non)religious identification, employing also the concept of Multiple Religious Belonging. Beside the information on religiosity, the results of the analysis also give interesting information about nonreligious identities in a secular context. Still, general results of the survey awoke serious doubts about the suitability of quantitative survey on conventional religion in a largely nonreligious society. In order to investigate the relevance of the quantitative survey, I conducted a qualitative study among the nonreligious using mainly the same questions and offering a possibility to explain one’s answers. The results largely confirmed my doubts. The paper addresses the issues that became clear during the qualitative study.

These studies, mostly on the North American spectrum of atheist, humanist, and secularist organizations, have treated their subject, quite matter-of-factly, as a social movement. In my presentation, I would like to apply theoretical insight from the sociology of social movements to the study of nonreligion and secularity – more specifically to atheist, humanist, and secularist activism in the United States and Germany. On the one hand, I would like to analyze systematically in how far the field of organized and non-organized atheism, humanism, and secularism meets definitions of a social movement and in how far it can justifiably be called that. Most definitions of social movements place emphasis on the existence of formal and informal networks of collective and individual actors, a shared identity, a battle against political or cultural enemies, and the use of non-institutionalized means. So, on the other hand, I am going to portray the formal and informal networks in this field as well as recent dynamics and divergencies with respect to identity, opponents, and strategy using theories of collective action and collective identity.

Making implicit nonreligious attitudes visible: secular criticism of religion and spirituality within societal institutions,Christiane Königstedt,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The study of nonreligion is, besides analyses of state secularism, very often concerned with nonreligious persons in the minority position, who are themselves perceived as contestations to religious world-views. For the opposite case, i.e. secular societies where nonreligious world-views are also dominant, Charles Taylor and José Casanova (2011) stated, that the latter would have the tendency to “naturalize” and thus become unconsciously held attitudes. Since what is taken for granted is rarely mentioned explicitly as well as there is by no means a canonized set of nonreligious beliefs collectively shared, those are difficult investigate beyond visible conflicts provoked by either religious groups or by perceived transgressions of taken-for-granted secular realms. Contestations and resulting negotiations may constitute a chance for the researcher (Knott 2007) to investigate 'naturalized’ assumptions, when it is explicated in order to explain the criticism groups, beliefs or practices. While it has shown that collective actors, groups, are more likely to be differentiated from the “in-group” through evoking a secular collective identity, subtle punctual transgressions of boundaries may reveals details about more diffused nonreligious – and implicit – attitudes and opinions. In this paper I will analyse examples for the latter case, precisely a sample of criticism(s) expressed in German online-newspapers towards perceived transgressions of legitimate (often medical) science by religio-spiritual world-views. Testing Taylor’s and Casanova’s claim in this practical area, the pivotal questions are 'what is precisely perceived as challenge and how is it characterized’? What is, on the other hand, perceived to be in need of protection, what are the feared dangers? What singular arguments and values are explicated in that defence?

Early-Modern Irreligion and Theological Analogy: A Response to Gavin Hyman’s A Short History of Atheism,Daniel J. Linford,Thomas Nelson Community College,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Historically, many Christians have understood God’s transcendence to imply God’s properties categorically differ from any created properties. For multiple historical figures, a problem arose for religious language: how can one talk of God at all if none of our predicates apply to God? What are we to make of creeds and Biblical passages that seem to predicate creaturely properties, such as goodness and wisdom, of God? Thomas Aquinas offered a solution: God is to be spoken of only through analogy (the doctrine of analogy). Gavin Hyman argues Aquinas’s doctrine of analogy was neglected prior to the early-modern period and the neglect of analogy produced the conception of a god vulnerable to atheistic arguments. Contra Hyman, in this paper, I show early-modern atheism arose in a theological context in which there was an active debate concerning analogy. Peter Browne (1665–1735) and William King (1650–1729) offered two competing conceptions of analogical predication that were debated through the 19th century, with interlocutors such as the freethinker Anthony Collins (1676–1729), theologian/philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and skeptic David Hume (1711–1776).

Measuring Atheism: Differentiating Non-religiosity and Anti-religiosity,Egbert Ribberink,KU Leuven,Belgium,M,Peter Achterberg,Tilburg University,Netherlands,M,Dick Houtman,KU Leuven,Belgium,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Egbert Ribberink, Peter Achterberg and Dick Houtman explore the problematic nature of measuring and differentiating atheism, non-religion and anti-religiosity and call for using existing large-scale surveys to understand said phenomena. From their recent research they detail the particular obstacles they overcame and elucidate how different questions on measuring non-belief produce much different answers.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In quantitative analysis, atheism is often used as a concept to describe those who state that they do not believe, when asked what they believe about God or those that indicate that they are not a member of a religious organization. It seems as if researchers treat atheism as the 'residual category’ in their study of religion. However, the recent debate on atheism, religious 'nones’ and non-religiosity suggests that this sociological habit of categorizing non-believers and non-affiliates as atheists, does not do justice to the intricacies of the atheist identity. There exists a great difference between say, an attender of an atheist gathering like the Sunday Assembly and a supporter of the American Atheists movement. Therefore, quantitatively oriented scholars should be very careful in their operationalization of the tolerant and almost spiritual kind of atheism on the one hand (better described as non-religious or a-religious), and the militant and provocative atheism on the other (better depicted as anti-religious). In our recent studies on non-religiosity and anti-religiosity in Western Europe, we discovered that operationalizing these differences is not so easy. We encountered three particular obstacles. First, the commonly used surveys for the study of religion, culture, and politics (for instance, EVS, ISSP) use different questions for measuring similar religious beliefs and attitudes. Second, they have very few items that lend themselves to distinguishing anti-religiosity from non-religiosity in general and religious indifference in particular. Third, there are a limited number of options for operationalizing different kinds of anti-religiosity, for example anti-Muslim sentiment. Now, researchers like us have two options: we could decide to dismiss datasets designed to measure religiosity as useless for understanding non-religiosity; or we could gloss over the differences and imagine that non-religiosity really is quite a straightforward matter.

Rather, such findings are relevant for understanding more indirect causes of people’s behavior and for explaining why certain types of explicit beliefs are more easily spread. When studying implicit processes in the context of religion and nonreligion, researchers have utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. A common methodological feature that these studies share is that they assess people’s beliefs indirectly. This means that, instead of asking the participants to report their own evaluation of the effects of their beliefs, participants are not fully aware of the particular beliefs the researchers are measuring.","belief,nsrn,method,blog,series,elisa,järnefelt,method,religion,belief,one,attitude,behaviour,relationship,awareness,people,self,understanding,belief,identity,account,thought,importance,level,belief,people,finding,cause,people,behavior,type,belief,process,context,religion,nonreligion,researcher,method,feature,study,people,belief,participant,evaluation,effect,belief,participant,belief,researcher"

However, the investigation of the phenomenon of apostasy has mainly been restricted to Christian apostates. Apostasy in minority communities, specifically the Muslim community, is not well understood. This study investigates the why and the how of the construction of the 'Ex-Muslim' identity, defined as atheists and agnostics who have left Islam. A small-scale study with a qualitative, grounded theory approach within a social constructivism paradigm was used to explore the construction of the Ex-Muslim identity, and how Ex-Muslims managed and negotiated the stigma attached to their identity. Ten semistructured interviews and one focus group (five participants) were conducted to investigate why participants chose to call themselves 'Ex-Muslims' and what the consequences of embracing this identity were. Results revealed two dimensions to understand this identity. The first category conceptualises the stigmatisation from Muslim and the non-Muslim society, and a displacement of the self, lack of parental acceptance and gendered experiences as the defining factors in the realities of Ex-Muslims. The second category showed the strategies used to navigate the Ex-Muslim identity, consisting of a complex set of performance acts to manage social interactions as well as the construction of an Ex-Muslim community. The results show that the conditions of stigmatisation of apostasy can stimulate the displacement of the self, resulting into an evolving Ex-Muslim identity. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of negotiation of identities through performances (Goffman, 1963) as well as the concept of the 'ex' role identity (Ebaugh, 1988).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"muslim,phenomenon,people,religion,feature,society,investigation,phenomenon,apostasy,apostate,apostasy,minority,community,community,study,construction,identity,atheist,agnostic,islam,scale,study,theory,approach,constructivism,paradigm,construction,identity,muslim,stigma,identity,interview,focus,group,participant,participant,muslim,consequence,identity,result,dimension,identity,category,stigmatisation,society,displacement,self,lack,acceptance,experience,factor,reality,muslim,category,strategy,identity,set,performance,act,interaction,construction,community,result,condition,stigmatisation,apostasy,displacement,self,identity,finding,light,concept,negotiation,identity,performance,goffman,concept,role,identity,ebaugh"

My sources include fan art, cartoons, and Internet memes. This paper therefore adopts a cultural studies approach to contemporary atheism, contributing an understanding of how atheism operates “on the ground” as much more than a simple lack of belief. Much has been made about the works of New Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, but relatively little has been done to analyze how they are consumed and reproduced, interpreted and critiqued, by everyday atheists. I address the tension between contemporary atheists’ skepticism regarding traditional authority and their simultaneous acceptance of some modes and sources of authority. Atheists themselves are aware of this tension, and treat it thoughtfully, playfully, and self-reflexively (jokingly calling Dawkins, for example, the Atheist Pope). I also connect my observations about authority in contemporary atheism with a commentary about gender in today’s atheist network, a subject for which my cultural sources provide rich material.

Despite collapses in trust and practice since the promulgation of the clerical sexual abuse scandals from the early 1990s onwards and a swiftly growing minority identifying as non-religious, survey data still return unusually high levels of religious belief and affiliation in Ireland by European standards, something that has led sociologists to propose that by and large the Irish population remain 'believers’ and 'cultural Catholics’ despite their growing lack of institutional engagement (Davie, 1994; Donnelly & Inglis, 2009). My research examines the accuracy of this characterisation utilising a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Dublin with experimental techniques built on a theoretical standpoint taken from the cognitive science of religion. These experiments aim to directly test whether religious credence is undermined when cultural learners witness 'Credibility Undermining Displays’, namely instances where religious paragons fail to 'practice what they preach’ (Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012).

Although these LGBT Christians used “non-religious” as a catchall term without ever specifying exactly who it captured, they used the first two definitions to apply to non-religious people in general regardless of sexuality while explicitly focusing on non-religious sexual minorities in their third definition. Moreover, I show how these definitions echoed mainstream religious rhetoric in America used to marginalize both sexual and religious minorities.

However, this self-identification is far from a wholesale rejection of religion, and often employed both to reject and affirm religious behaviors and identities. Most typically, nonreligious attitudes reject religious dispositions that are perceived as deviant, unhealthy, or foreign while simultaneously affirming religion’s importance. Nonreligious individuals tend to rely on religious professionals and vicariously entrust specialized acts of prayer and ritual to religious authorities when desirable and appropriate. Along with various Buddhist and Shinto rites, Christian wedding ceremonies are now one of the occasions where nonreligious Japanese rely on religious professionals. Nonreligious attitudes are responsible for significant transformations in Japanese Christianity and the bridal industry and the successful response of the Christian churches and the bridal industry to consumer demand has led to an explosion in Christian wedding ceremonies. In short, the popularity of Christian weddings among nonreligious individuals has transformed the policies and approaches of Christian churches and created new Christian ritual venues and religious organizations.","japan,conversion,christianity,post,jesse,lefebvre,enigma,nonreligiosity,presence,increase,wedding,japan,strategy,mission,industry,majority,self,self,identification,rejection,religion,behavior,identity,attitude,disposition,religion,importance,individual,professional,act,prayer,ritual,authority,rite,wedding,ceremony,occasion,japanese,professional,attitude,transformation,christianity,industry,response,church,industry,consumer,demand,explosion,wedding,ceremony,popularity,wedding,individual,policy,approach,church,venue,organization"

Consequently, I began to investigate atheism with the cognitive and evolutionary sciences in mind, conducting fieldwork with atheist and humanist groups in the US, UK, and Denmark and running interviews, surveys, and experiments. Taking a cognitive perspective, I believe, allows us to escape the post-modern malaise that too-often arises when we recognize the socially-constructed nature of our key objects of analysis.

On the Necessity of Fractionating “Atheism”,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Can “atheism,” be an object of scientific analysis? Academics and other social actors approach “atheism” with a range of interests, producing substantial diversity in how the term is defined, analysed, and utilised. Given the importance of such interests in conceptual construction, one may ask whether “atheism” exists as an independent phenomenon amenable to scientific analysis, or, rather, following the supposed fate of “religion” (Smith, 1998; Fitzgerald, 2000) and the “secular” (Asad, 2003), as a mere social construction. This question is not without consequence. If “atheism” only exists as a socially constructed concept and not as an independent object, then analysis of its supposed causes and effects becomes, like astrology, folly. I will argue that “atheism” is indeed a social construct. This would seem to doom any scientific study of atheism and leave us only to document how the term is experienced and utilized by various social actors. However, I will argue that a science of atheism is still possible. To do so, I will utilize the metatheoretical principle of “fractionation” developed by cognitive anthropologists (Boyer, 1994; Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014) in their scientific studies of “religion.” Fractionating a constructed object of analysis involves breaking it up into distinct phenomena about whose independence we are more confident and which may have divergent causes and effects. Based on my field and survey research with atheists in the US, UK, and Denmark, as well as insights from the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, I will propose three (non-exhaustive) fractionated elements of “atheism:” 1) absence of (implicit/explicit) belief in the existence of God/gods, 2) moral judgement of the immorality of “religion,” and 3) social identities that prominently feature “atheism” or other forms of “nonreligion.” I will argue that each exists in the world beyond our scholarly conceptions and with distinct sets of causes and effects.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"necessity,atheism,atheism,object,analysis,academic,actor,atheism,range,interest,diversity,term,importance,interest,construction,atheism,phenomenon,analysis,fate,religion,smith,fitzgerald,asad,construction,question,consequence,atheism,concept,object,analysis,cause,effect,astrology,folly,atheism,construct,study,atheism,term,actor,science,atheism,principle,fractionation,anthropologist,boyer,whitehouse,lanman,study,religion,object,analysis,phenomenon,independence,cause,effect,field,research,atheist,denmark,insight,science,element,atheism,absence,belief,existence,god,god,judgement,immorality,religion,identity,atheism,form,nonreligion,world,conception,set,cause,effect"
Reimagining the Secular: The Sunday Assembly - Belonging without Believing.,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Grace Davie (1994) famously wrote over two decades ago that 'the overall pattern of religious life is changing. For it appears that more and more people within British Society want to believe but do not want to involve themselves in religious practice.’ Hence, the catchphrase 'believing without belonging’ was coined. Twenty-two years later has the (non)religious landscape changed once again? My doctoral research follows the Sunday Assembly, a secular congregation that celebrates life, with the motto: live better, help often and wonder more. Their vision is: to help everyone live life as fully as possible. The Sunday Assembly entered the non-religious market place in January 2013 with their flagship London congregation. Now, 68- franchised chapters of the Godless congregation exist in 8 different countries, attempting to provide community, belonging and wonder to the religiously unaffiliated market. Once described as 'the best bits of church but with no religion and with awesome pop songs!’, the best bits literally borrow established successful terminology, practices, liturgies and models of building community found within Christian churches. Often labelled oxymoronically the 'atheist church’ - it parallels and mimics the functionality of church life without the need for a deity. Therefore, studying the Sunday Assembly may offer a new variation to Davie’s 'believing without belonging’ that is 'belonging without believing.’ As more and more people now identify as being non-religious in the United Kingdom and America, this paper will aim to answer what factors are enticing people towards the Sunday Assembly and their nonreligious practice. This paper will present findings from my analysis of the Sunday Assembly.

Non-Religious Individuals’ Life Satisfaction: Examining the Role of Belief Certainty and Context Factors,Katharina Pöhls,University of Cologne,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Based on the assumption of a curvilinear effect of belief certainty instead of belief content on psychological well-being, this individual paper explores the influence of belief certainty on non-religious individuals’ life satisfaction with regard to the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development. Self-identification as atheist is used as an indicator for non-religiousness with a high belief certainty. The social norm of non-religiosity is indicated by the national level of individuals identifying as not religious or atheist and the level of societal development is indicated by the level of a population’s health, education, and standard of living. The World Values Survey is used as data source for a quantitative intercultural comparison across 31 countries (N=49,611). Results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average more satisfied with life than atheist and non-religious individuals when only including individual-level variables in the analysis, but that they do not differ in their average level of life satisfaction when interactions with the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development are considered.

So what causes anti-atheist prejudice both inside and outside of the political arena?  Why are atheists viewed so negatively in the United States, even by other atheists?

Evidence of the Role of Existential Threat on Anti-Atheist Prejudice. Adding to the ever-growing body of research on anti-atheist prejudice, which has already connected such prejudice to concerns about atheists being untrustworthy and threatening to in-group values, this study focused on the existential threat that atheism poses to theistic worldviews. Specifically, the researchers based their hypotheses on terror management theory, originally developed by Solomon himself along with two other psychologists, which posits that “the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror that is assuaged by cultural worldviews that afford a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe,” in order to see whether atheists, by holding to a worldview which denies a belief in God or an afterlife, threaten to undermine the terror-buffer that religious worldviews often generate. In brief, the two separate experiments in this study found a significant empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudice.","terror,management,theory,prejudice,america,kyle,thompson,prejudice,worldview,atheist,comparison,group,atheist,public,atheist,public,office,prejudice,arena,atheist,state,atheist,question,study,psychologist,corey,cook,florette,cohen,sheldon,solomon,afterlife,evidence,role,threat,prejudice,body,research,prejudice,prejudice,concern,atheist,group,value,study,threat,atheism,worldview,researcher,hypothesis,terror,management,theory,solomon,psychologist,awareness,death,rise,terror,worldview,sense,participant,universe,order,atheist,worldview,belief,god,afterlife,terror,buffer,worldview,brief,experiment,study,link,concern,prejudice"

By using a historical case study, Fraser hopes to push back against viewing atheism as either a purely political or purely intellectual phenomenon and instead suggests that only a multi-disciplinary study can fully make sense of atheism.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"It is a common belief in many Western societies that politics and religion should be separate, and that religion should play little or no role in the governance of modern states. This belief, in turn, can support two other assumptions: first, that it is possible to have religious beliefs whose significance is purely intellectual, and which possess no political meaning; and second, that the absence or rejection of religious language, symbols, and narratives in political life implies neutrality or indifference toward the intellectual cogency of religious belief. These beliefs can affect the methodologies we use, as is seen in different approaches toward New Atheism. On the one hand are a range of polemical works that seek to defend or refute the intellectual plausibility of its core arguments, with little consideration of its social and political significance. On the other hand are works by Schulzke, Kettell, and McAnulla, which have sought to move beyond this intellectual and polemical approach by conceptualising New Atheism as a primarily political movement. In contrast to these overly intellectual or political methods, historians of Protestant freethought such as Budd, Reventlow, and Champion have long noted the inter-dependent relationship between atheism, theology, and political protest.","mind,revolt,lesson,freethought,study,atheism,article,liam,jerrold,fraser,examination,seventeenth-,century,freethought,atheism,case,study,fraser,atheism,phenomenon,study,sense,atheism,belief,society,politic,religion,religion,role,governance,state,belief,turn,assumption,belief,significance,meaning,absence,rejection,language,symbol,narrative,life,neutrality,indifference,cogency,belief,belief,methodology,approach,atheism,hand,range,work,plausibility,core,argument,consideration,significance,hand,work,schulzke,kettell,mcanulla,approach,atheism,movement,contrast,method,historian,freethought,budd,reventlow,champion,relationship,atheism,theology,protest"
"Jewish Atheists, Protestant Humanists and Nonreligious Agnostics: Existential Culture, 'Hybridity’ and Nonreligious Diversity",Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The existential dimension of human life has been a minor theme in contemporary social science, in line with the dominant view in social theory (e.g. modernization theory, secularization theory) that the decline of religion, detraditionalisation and other processes of social transformation serve to diminish existential experience in modern and late modern societies. In contrast to such theories, this paper presents evidence that existential life is reformed rather than reduced in contemporary societies. It draws on qualitative research exploring nonreligious identification in southeast England to demonstrate the ways in which informants engage with the existential and metaphysical, not only through thought and belief, but also through rituals, symbolic forms and social interactions. It shows how the variety and cultural contingency of these existential cultures can provide new ways to understand the diversity of nonreligious beliefs and cultures. It also points to commonalities and opportunities for cultural exchange between religious, spiritual and nonreligious existential cultures, and the ways in which individuals may draw on and sometimes combine these different traditions.

For new scholars, the challenge is accessing all that these earlier scholars have learned – and ensuring that they don’t have to repeat the same conceptual explorations, or wander up the blind alleys that others have already realised are dead-ends. Today, the issue is much more about having a centralised body of work to turn to, a point of access to a resource setting out, simply and clearly, what others have already learned. To date, there has been a lack of standardization, not only across disciplines but within them, leading either to uncertainty about a concept’s meaning or crossed-wires.

Take, for example, the striking gender imbalance in the atheist movement – one of the most prominent gender issues in the field. Why so few women? It may then be the case that women do not differ from men in their initial attraction to atheist activities, but the gap widens as a result of women’s direct experience of the atheist milieu. The initial gendering of the atheist movement, through the high profiles of its male figures and marginalisation of their female counterparts, sets the tone for the subsequent patterns of participation. The focus on atheism in studies of nonreligion is also inevitably gendered because the term 'atheist’ tends to appeal more to men than to women who prefer 'agnostic’ or 'not religious’.","girl,gender,nonreligion,contribution,nsrn,method,blog,marta,methodology,account,gender,methodology,gender,study,intersection,gender,atheism,nonreligion,secularity,phenomenon,challenge,outset,point,research,design,issue,example,gender,imbalance,movement,gender,issue,field,woman,case,woman,man,attraction,activity,gap,result,woman,experience,milieu,gendering,movement,profile,figure,marginalisation,counterpart,tone,pattern,participation,focus,atheism,study,nonreligion,term,atheist,man,woman"
Contested Secularism(s) in Bangladesh,Mascha Schulz,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism and the role of religion in the public sphere in Bangladesh have been highly contested issues in Bangladesh since a long period, but contestation and polarization have regained remarkable intensity in the recent past. In this context also the academic writing on the issue of secularism, national identity and religion in Bangladesh and concomitant conflicts has remerged with new impetus. In this presentation I will explore the light that recent academic writing sheds on contested secularism in Bangladesh. I will summarize the existing literature by pointing to different narratives and motives frequently presented in the literature. This will help us to understand how these contestations around religion and secularism in Bangladesh are commonly interpreted and how various issues and conflicts are conflated within these debates. As a second step, I will discuss to which extend the scholarly works can themselves be considered as part of politics around the contested issue of “secularism” and the role of religion in Bangladesh. Therefore, I will summarize which implicit or explicit claims or political statements are made by the authors, and in which ways these statements relate to the positions of respective authors as well as academia in general. Further, I would like to contrast the academic discourse concerning issues related to secularism in Bangladesh to the emerging scholarship that discusses ways of conceptualizing non-religion and secularism. Consequently, I will use a few selected approaches to argue that a conversation between both so far largely disconnected corpuses of scholarship can be of mutual benefit as it allows a critical review of the existing narratives and debates in both of them. I will conclude my presentation with proposing possible approaches that will allow us a deeper understanding of the politics of secularism in Bangladesh.

She thoroughly documents the role of freethinkers in France that follows the work of Albert Bayet and Pierre Leveque. However, Lalouette, Bayet, and Leveque give a limited analysis of the reasons for the rupture with the Church. Lalouette briefly notes that freethinkers were born into freethought families, revolted intellectually, or morally rejected the idea of God (such as after experiencing the horrors of World War One). Studying the deconversion testimonies of the évadés and freethinkers puts their voice back into the historical record. They believed they were living through a great spiritual crisis and transition. The Church could have found a way to embrace change. Instead, the Catholic hierarchy resisted reform, pushing many believers into a tenuous spirituality or unbelief and direct cultural conflict.","church,article,conrad,importance,voice,freethinker,clergy,nineteenth,twentieth,century,conrad,light,period,history,factor,secularization,france,historian,account,philosopher,writer,story,unbelief,group,intelligentsia,publication,jacqueline,lalouette,book,libre,pensée,france,unbelief,class,role,freethinker,france,work,albert,bayet,pierre,lalouette,bayet,analysis,reason,rupture,church,lalouette,freethinker,freethought,family,idea,god,horror,world,war,deconversion,testimony,évadés,freethinker,voice,record,crisis,transition,church,way,change,hierarchy,reform,believer,spirituality,unbelief,conflict"
Being areligious in Antiquity – Individual Dimensions of Disbelief,Nicole Hartmann,Humboldt-University of Berlin,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Studies on Antiquity are mostly stuck in their dependence on literary sources. Philosophical, antiquarian, judicial or theological reflections, tragic, satirical, polemical or apologetic texts were mostly produced by 'organizational men' (Jörg Rüpke). They set the agenda of proper behaviour, norms and practices and, what they consider to be deviant. They create the dichotomy of 'religion' and 'atheism'. „Battling the Gods. Atheism in the Ancient World“ (2015) by Tim Whitmarsh is just the latest example of how difficult it is for scholars to look beyond these dominating discourses. The project I am thinking about aims at individual aspects of disbelief and personal reasons for denying to participate in rituals and cults or merely being indifferent towards 'religion'. So far my approach is informed by the 'Lived Ancient Religion' concept of the ERC funded Research Group at the Max Weber Kolleg Erfurt and the theoretical framework of the 'Multiple Secularities' project at the University of Leipzig. The biggest methodological challenge will be the quest for sources and testimonies, since there are no ego-documents of 'confessing' sceptics or atheists. One has to analyze indirect sources as, for example, leges sacrae and will meet a lot of difficulties to distinguish wilful disregard from unintentional transgression etc. Nonetheless, in my point of view, it is about time to conceptualize these individual dimensions of non-religion for the ancient world (namely in the time and space of the Roman Empire) and ask about the dynamics it set free in groups responses.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"antiquity,dimension,disbelief,study,antiquity,dependence,source,reflection,text,man,jörg,rüpke,agenda,behaviour,norm,practice,dichotomy,religion,atheism,god,atheism,world,tim,whitmarsh,example,scholar,discourse,project,aim,aspect,disbelief,reason,ritual,cult,religion,approach,religion,concept,erc,research,group,max,weber,kolleg,erfurt,framework,secularitie,project,university,leipzig,challenge,quest,source,testimony,document,sceptic,atheist,source,example,leges,sacrae,lot,difficulty,disregard,transgression,etc,point,view,time,dimension,religion,world,time,space,empire,dynamic,group,response"

I make this argument by reflecting on the sermon that Giorgio Agamben gave in Notre Dame Cathedral in March 2009. The argument has three main components: 1) the church is understood to be a community of foreigners and exiles as opposed to citizens of a city, state, kingdom or empire; 2) the church is marked by a distinctive relation to time which is in tension with the chronological timeframe of a particular socio-political construct of law or state, in our case Western neo-liberal representative democracy; 3) the way that community can form and flourish is in an extraordinary kind of tension between the poles presented in the first two points, namely aliens and citizens and chronological and eschatological time. Taking these components in order, I will look at several characteristics from the genealogy of Western European Secularity that can help provide for this ecclesial recovery. I will then suggest that there can be a positive tension between secularity and a Jesus style of church, and that this can engender a flourishing community for all. I will then refer to the current refugee crisis as a context for this.","god,secularity,attempt,relationship,secularity,community,roger,mitchell,thought,establishment,society,separation,authority,community,consequence,people,argument,progress,secularity,society,recovery,church,jesus,testament,gospel,story,argument,sermon,giorgio,agamben,notre,dame,cathedral,march,argument,component,church,community,foreigner,exile,citizen,city,state,kingdom,empire,church,relation,time,tension,timeframe,construct,law,state,case,democracy,way,community,kind,tension,pole,point,alien,citizen,time,component,order,characteristic,genealogy,secularity,recovery,tension,secularity,jesus,style,church,community,refugee,crisis,context"

This blog has focused on a limited set of US-based surveys, but similar effects have been found elsewhere. What this work shows is that scholars interested in studying nonreligious and nonbelieving individuals need to recognize that how questions are framed will influence the results they get. There are many ways to ask about religious belonging and believing, and most of these aren’t intrinsically wrong or right – so long as the data are analysed and interpreted in a way that is sensitive to what the question is doing.

I also argue that hiloni cultivation of reasonableness is an emotio-political outcome of a long-standing and unresolved ideological problem within Zionist thought. Reasonableness is not simply an emotional practice of self-cultivation but has also – indirectly and often unintentionally – facilitated and rendered opaque practices of Israeli state sovereignty over many aspects of Palestinian life.

The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the 'practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory.

In America, atheism is still viewed with suspicion, and consistently one of the most distrusted minorities. Particularly in places like the deep southern states, identifying as an atheist remains problematic. YouTube, however, has facilitated 'coming out’ as an atheist, a topic that has been of interest to researchers in the sociology of religion. My research has shown that religious discussions and arguments cannot be divorced from the social context in which they take place. This has grown increasingly more complicated with the development of new mobile technology and the integration of offline and online lives. My research now looks at the ways in which 'context collapse’ (or the diverse audiences watching users on social media from a variety of different, disparate backgrounds) has affected how users present themselves and their beliefs or lack of beliefs online.

Elsewhere online, the boundary between religion and nonreligion becomes much harder to trace. If we only pay attention to the most explicit forms of anti-religion, we risk missing some of the more subtle and interesting negotiations of what it actually means to be (or not to be) “religious”. We can also miss whole areas of activity in which the boundary doesn’t seem to mean very much at all. As Dusty Hoesly argues in a recent article in Secularism and Nonreligion, 'religious, spiritual, secular, and nonreligious identities are not stable, unitary formations’, but performances, 'discursive, relational constructions contingently articulated in particular locations at specific times for particular purposes’. Researchers interested in digital nonreligion need to look out for those performances, and to develop methodologies that are sensitive to their transient contexts and implications.","angel,afterlife,nonreligion,instalment,nsrn,method,blog,tim,hutchings,scope,significance,methodology,study,nonreligion,area,internet,line,religion,nonreligion,boundary,religion,nonreligion,attention,form,religion,negotiation,area,activity,boundary,hoesly,article,secularism,nonreligion,identity,formation,performance,construction,location,time,purpose,researcher,nonreligion,performance,methodology,context,implication"

A bear, wearing a Christmas hat, invites me to “get merry this Christmas – and not just on our beer”. I was about to dismiss the poster as a depressing example of the needless secularization and commercialisation of Christmas. Though barely raised Christian, I suppose I had always assumed that Christian symbols such as, say, the nativity scene, still reminded what we might call post-Christian (raised Christian and still influenced by Christian culture despite neither believing nor attending church) celebrants that Christmas was about remembering the poor. I was about to dismiss the poster, but realising I had nothing better to do, decided to read on. In fact, the Christmas bear invited me to get merry by gifting money to a poor child. I had been too quick to judge. Later, I saw how those taking up the offer had been incorporated into a public ritual,immortalized by writing their name beside a picture of the child they had helped on a paper tag, which had been draped in the branches of a Christmas tree, where normally decorative baubles might hang. I reflected on how a secular Christmas had nonetheless sacralized and ritualised giving and receiving, and this ritual in itself might be a strong enough anchor from which to inspire solidarity with the poor.","christmas,bear,reflection,sacred,christmas,stacey,spirit,period,urinal,pub,bangalore,india,christmas,themed,poster,bear,christmas,hat,christmas,beer,poster,example,secularization,christmas,symbol,nativity,scene,culture,church,celebrant,christmas,poster,fact,christmas,bear,money,child,offer,ritual,picture,child,paper,tag,branch,christmas,tree,bauble,christmas,ritual,anchor,solidarity"
The Varieties of Personal Orientations to Religion: Dynamics of Religious and Nonreligious Positions in Self-Narratives of Well-Educated Young Adults in the Netherlands,Ulrike Popp-Baier,University of Amsterdam,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Self-narratives are well-known resources from which to analyze the subtleties of people’s orientations toward “religion“. They provide the necessary biographical context for addressing individual religiousness in the context of personal concerns, experiences and orientations, thus stressing the diversity and varieties of people’s religious orientations and experiences which are embedded in processes of interpretation and reflection related to activities and events in daily life, and evolving and changing in the course of a lifetime. “Religious” or “nonreligious” people are often not only addressing, adopting, or contesting various contents of belief in plural religious contexts, but also demonstrating various “modes of belief or unbelief ” such as being convinced, trusting, hoping, assuming, preferring, doubting, pondering, denying etc. When we consider these varieties, clear-cut distinctions between “being religious” and “being nonreligious” will often disappear. The main research question in our current project is: What types of religiousness are discernable among well-educated adults in the Netherlands ? We started our empirical research with a preliminary exploratory study which is still ongoing. Until yet 20 selfnarratives (gained by a combination of biographical-narrative interviews with semi-structured interviews) of students at polytechnic institutes of higher learning in the Netherlands have been gathered. The purposive sample aims at maximal variation among self-ascribed religiousness, spirituality, nonreligiousness and non-spirituality. Thus far Catholics and former Catholics, Protestants and former Protestants, Muslims, people affiliated with the socalled holistic milieu and people with no religious affiliation or interest in spirituality at all have been included into the sample. Besides different constellations of religiousness, nonreligiousness, spirituality and “non-spirituality”, a thematic coding analysis of the 20 interviewtranscripts also revealed two common patterns in the interviews thus far: a moral orientation to life and variations of a just-world belief (Lerner, 1980).

She shows how reframing such research as stimulating of 'unbelief’ open new avenues for new ways of exploring the nature of unbelief and its similarities and dissimilarities to religious and spiritual beliefs.,2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Recent technological advances have made it possible to influence brain processes through neuromodulation. This is a technology which influences neurons in the brain through either focused magnetic fields (such as in transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS for short) or a weak electrical current emitted by electrodes placed on the skull (transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS for short). TMS can induce or impede action potentials in neurons, thus stimulating or inhibiting brain regions, while tDCS modulates the neuronal excitability of the target area – this can be positive, when the neuronal excitability is increased, or negative, when the neuronal excitability is decreased. Together these studies suggest that neuromodulation can induce changes in beliefs. The majority of the studies used TMS, and in particular inhibitory TMS. A number of questions remain, and they point to questions of significance for the study of 'unbelieving’ as well as religious and spiritual forms of believing: How long lasting and powerful are the effects of neuromodulation on belief, and what does this tell us about the stability of belief and unbelief between contexts and over time? Can neuromodulation turn an atheist into a devout believer – or a religious individual into an ardent atheist? Or do articulate forms of 'positive atheism’ also provide opportunities for self-transcendence so that some forms of unbelief behave similarly to religious and spiritual belief? What brain regions need to be targeted to achieve these changes, and what does this tell us about the nature of belief and unbelief?

Methodological challenges in conducting research on irreligious Tunisians,Yosr Ben Slima,King's College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will examine the methodological difficulties related to the study of the nonreligion phenomenon within Tunisia (a Muslim-majority country). I argue that the problem stems from the difficulty of defining and locating nonreligion, especially in the absence of any forms of organization. Certain material manifestations of nonreligion can be signs of unorthodox Islam rather than material signs of nonreligion ,while abidance by some Islamic rituals is not necessarily a sign of piety and belief. I propose the neologism 'practicing irreligious Tunisians’ to refer to irreligious individuals who consciously choose to continue performing Islamic rituals. Abiding by certain Islamic rituals has become for these irreligious Tunisians living with traditional Muslim families, a manner to develop more empathy, by refusing to inflict pain on their beloved ones. This moral consideration is shaped by what these irreligious Tunisians refer to as 'humane values’ or in a more ironic manner ' ethics of Kofar’2 . The methodological challenge resides in distinguising between unorthodoxy and nonreligion .Who is a real irreligious Tunisian ? To understand the subversive nature of the irreligious performance of Islamic rituals , I rely on the virtual sphere which presents an outlet used by many irreligious Tunisians to express their 'authentic selves’. I combine both virtual ethnography and long-term relationships with irreligious Tunisians to explore nonreligion in a context where the fear of social rejection and the ambivalence of the legal system vis-à-vis nonreligious Tunisians make it difficult to openly approach the subject in the public sphere.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.,"challenge,research,tunisian,presentation,difficulty,study,nonreligion,phenomenon,tunisia,majority,country,problem,difficulty,nonreligion,absence,form,organization,material,manifestation,nonreligion,sign,islam,sign,nonreligion,abidance,ritual,sign,piety,belief,neologism,tunisian,individual,ritual,ritual,tunisian,family,manner,empathy,pain,one,consideration,tunisian,value,manner,ethic,kofar’2,challenge,distinguising,unorthodoxy,nonreligion,nature,performance,ritual,sphere,outlet,tunisian,self,ethnography,term,relationship,tunisian,nonreligion,context,fear,rejection,ambivalence,system,vis,vis,tunisian,subject,sphere"

Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i.e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing intersectional approaches to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.,"health,disparity,adult,state,epidemiology,condition,paper,prevalence,estimate,people,relation,condition,society,survey,datum,life,health,project,debate,relationship,religion,nonreligion,health,adult,population,finding,relationship,religion,nonreligion,condition,prevalence,race,sex,class,variation,people,health,outcome,pattern,analysis,population,conclusion,implication,research,importance,caution,correlation,religion,i.e.,location,health,approach,religion,nonreligion,health,base,scholarship,nonreligion,health"

This means that the vast majority of them reflected on a number of issues, particularly life meaning and morality, building this way a distinct atheist identity which is not any more identified exclusively with anti-Orthodox attitudes.

In this media response blog, Atko Remmel addresses the problems with survey questions, the conflation of terminology and how we measure religion to analyse if God really has returned to Eastern Europe.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Referring to a Pew Research Center study “Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe”, a recent Washington Times editorial rejoices about the resurgence of religion in Eastern Europe, titling the text “God returns to Eastern Europe”. The message is simple: godless Commies failed and religion is back, prospering again much as it did a hundred years ago. At first glance, the data presented in the article seems to support this understanding: 86% of Russians ascribe to some variant of religious belief and 44% of Russians claim to be “quite religious”. Moreover, the percentage of atheists has dropped by half from 26 to 13% in last three years. While it is definitely true that religion in post-Soviet society is in a much better position than during the project of “forced secularization” (Froese 2004), the author(s) of the editorial may have got some things wrong and missed some important points. First of all, although the editorial claims to rely on Pew study, some of the data seem to originate from Levada Center’s (Russian counterpart of the Pew Research Center) recent survey on religiosity in Russia (report in Russian), mediated to Anglophone readers by Breitbart News – during which some things have been clearly lost in translation. For instance, looking at the original Levada report, 44% of “quite religious” Russians turn out to be “somewhat religious” and only 9% describe themselves as “very religious”. In sum, only about half of the population considers themselves more or less “religious”. Regarding the diminishing percentage of atheists, Levada data actually indicate a noticeable change (which instantly arises suspicion) among those, who said they are “totally irreligious”.","god,europe,washington,time,editorial,god,europe,medium,response,blog,atko,remmel,problem,survey,question,conflation,terminology,religion,god,europe,pew,research,center,study,belief,belonging,europe,washington,time,editorial,resurgence,religion,europe,text,god,europe,message,commie,religion,year,glance,datum,article,understanding,russian,variant,belief,russian,percentage,atheist,half,year,religion,society,position,project,secularization,author(s,editorial,thing,point,editorial,pew,study,datum,levada,center,counterpart,pew,research,center,survey,religiosity,russia,report,reader,breitbart,news,thing,translation,instance,levada,report,russian,sum,half,population,percentage,atheist,levada,datum,change,suspicion"

And like an unruly ghost, this narrative presence refuses to rest, producing the peculiar contradiction of faithful unbelief– in art, philosophy, and literature.  Yet, in the midst of this cultural paradox, there exists a stirring coherence.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Contemporary discussions of religious belief in the media are frequently conducted through the unaccommodating lenses of binary thinking. Either we either 'believe in God’ or we disbelieve. A religious story either makes sense to us or else we are baffled. What is perhaps less talked about however, are the so-called marginal cases where unbelief owes its structure and vitality to faith. So obsessed is our culture with 'the fundamentalist’ and the 'true believer’ that we rarely consider the religious life of the doubter. Such oversight is examined with verve and colour in Simon Critchley’s book Faith of the Faithless. Here the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde is described as one living a religiously ambiguous life. Neither straightforwardly Christian nor flatly apostate, Wilde’s sense of the sacred is continually mediated through the beauties of art, iconography and scripture. Such an aesthetic sensibility is forever slippery, neither rejecting Christianity nor fully embracing it. As Critchley suggests, this is 'the faith of the faithless and the belief of unbelievers, a faith which does not give up the idea of truth, but reinterprets it.’","structure,doubt,reflection,christ,atheism,ben,wood,way,culture,story,ghost,presence,contradiction,unbelief,art,philosophy,literature,midst,paradox,coherence,discussion,belief,medium,lense,thinking,god,story,sense,case,unbelief,structure,vitality,faith,culture,fundamentalist,believer,life,doubter,oversight,verve,colour,simon,book,faith,playwright,oscar,wilde,life,wilde,sense,sacred,beauty,art,iconography,scripture,sensibility,christianity,critchley,faith,belief,unbeliever,faith,idea,truth"

However, Christianity has been on the wane for decades in the U.S. and Europe.

In 1990, the last year of communist rule, religion was legalised. A myriad of Muslim and Christian traditions resurfaced, and Albanians of different religious persuasions celebrated their newborn freedom.

Evan finds that belief in evolution and education are not significant predictors of atheist identification when we control for political views.,2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Last year I published a review article laying out some of the challenges for studying atheism, particularly in the United States. We know that anti-atheist sentiment in the U.S. is persistent and durable, and that atheists do a lot of collective work to build a common sense of identity. As a result, my work argues that we have to carefully distinguish non-belief in god from atheist self-identification, since self-identification signals far more than non-belief alone. Choosing to call oneself an atheist in the United States means navigating stigma, community affinities, and relationships to authority, and it can therefore become a shortcut for a range of assumptions about matters of public concern. I used survey data to investigate the differences between non-belief and atheist self-identification, but the original analysis from the review article was not conclusive. Most surveys, even those that can measure (non)religion in detail, cannot get a large enough subsample of atheists to make strong claims. The study of nonreligion is developing into a robust field, drawing interest from across the social sciences and humanities. As it continues to grow, researchers who work in this area will continue to face questions about whether their findings are generalizable across different groups and whether they replicate in different social contexts.

Yet this view places religion and secularism into a binary relationship with each other, despite the scholarly efforts to demonstrate that this binary is the result of a particular Christian cultural-historical trajectory. The religion/secular binary is subsequently reflected in a series of related modern binaries, such as religion/politics; private/public, which are primarily ideological rather than having a basis in lived experience. The lived experience of Bengali Muslims revolves around dharma, a vernacular category that pushes through a religious/secular binary. My ethnographic exploration of Bengali Muslims’ understanding of dharma therefore provokes an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between religion, secularism and politics.","secularism,india,perspective,pool,finding,fieldwork,muslim,failure,secularism,experience,life,research,series,argument,secularism,india,lack,religion,cause,lack,secularism,secularism,separation,politic,religion,view,religion,secularism,relationship,effort,binary,result,trajectory,religion,binary,series,binary,religion,politic,public,basis,experience,experience,muslim,dharma,category,binary,exploration,muslim,understanding,dharma,way,relationship,religion,secularism,politic"
No religion really is the new religion,Hugh Rock,Independent scholar,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Linda Woodhead’s recent work has argued that 'no religion is the new religion’. In this blog, Hugh Rock asks whether is it now high time that the sociology of religion takes this suggestion much more seriously?",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Linda Woodhead’s address to this year’s EASR conference in Helsinki titled 'No Religion is the New Religion’ was, for me, distinctly thought provoking. As a rebellious theologian, I take that title to be literally true. But despite the implication, Woodhead was not theorising 'no religion’ as religion. What struck me about the disjunction between my conclusion about no religion and Woodhead’s hiatus, was that the title presages a potential conceptual advance that remains something of an obstacle because we have not quite completed the conceptual armoury needed to get round it; but that such an advance would be fertile in connecting up the wave of empirical studies of the non-religious, such as Woodhead, Lois Lee and many others have been engaging, with new work theorising the nonreligious. To summarize the result of this theorising, the category 'no religion’ for me comprises a raft of world-building, life-meaning-making endeavours, within the framework of a naturalistic worldview, that are sociologically indistinguishable from the world-building, life-orientating endeavours carried out within the framework of a theistic worldview. Therefore, I see in 'non-religion’ a spectrum of new naturalistic religions.","religion,religion,linda,work,religion,religion,blog,hugh,rock,time,sociology,religion,suggestion,linda,address,year,easr,conference,helsinki,religion,religion,theologian,title,implication,woodhead,religion,religion,disjunction,conclusion,religion,hiatus,title,advance,obstacle,armoury,advance,wave,study,woodhead,lois,lee,work,result,theorising,category,religion,raft,world,building,life,meaning,endeavour,framework,worldview,world,building,life,endeavour,framework,worldview,religion,spectrum,religion"

However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995–2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions.

Contrary to rational choice theorists who contend that there is ongoing demand for the things that religious groups offer (e.g. meaning and purpose in life, life after death), I question the assumption that if we simply adjust religious supply (e.g. better music or preaching, more programming, or more liberal theology) we should expect increased involvement in institutionalized forms of religious life.

In Carter there were 26 interveners, 12 of them religious. One of those was in favour of the idea of establishing an assisted dying regime. The rest were opposed. They used language like “suicide” and used the word “death” rather than “dying”, while nonreligious interveners used terms such as “end-of-life decisions”; “assisted dying”; “medically assisted dying”; “self-chosen death”. Nonreligious interveners framed their understanding of dying as including the possibility of a “good death”, which respected the wishes of the individual and preserved dignity.

A second assumption is that these understandings about women’s emancipation are constituted partly through scrutinising and critiquing the norms, positions and roles laid out for women in monotheistic religious traditions and communities. Secular normative statements about women’s equality and emancipation can, therefore, be studied as 'identity markers’ over and against religious communities.

"Straight Gods, White Devils: Exploring Paths to Non-Religion in the Lives of Black LGBTQ People",Simone Kolysh,The Graduate Center,New York,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"To examine paths to non-religion in the lives of black LGBTQ people, I analyze 10 interviews of black LGBTQ people who were raised Christian. Utilizing an intersectional lens, I conclude that lessons of the Christian home, reinforced in religious school and at church, drew a connection between Christianity, one’s racial and ethnic identity, and heterosexuality in such a way that being LGBTQ was marked un-Christian and foreign, and sometimes associated with whiteness. This further shaped how my participants navigated the urban public sphere, one of the only spheres where they could 'be LGBTQ’ – some neighborhoods were constructed as Christian, connected to one’s childhood and hostile to LGBTQ people, while others were LGBTQ-friendly, albeit largely white and gentrified. The overall impact of Christianity across multiple spheres influenced which non-religious paths my participants took. One remained with a Christian denomination of her childhood and one remained with a Christian denomination of her mother but not her father.

Secular Powers and Heretic Undercurrents in a God-Fearing Part of the World,Samuli Schielke,Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When we talk about “secular powers and heretic undercurrents”, “secular powers” provides an understanding of certain things. Secular powers are good to understand some stuff, and not good enough to understand heretic undercurrents, the kind of shadow, or in a more positive sense, the halo that surrounds any tradition that tries to produce an orthodoxy. However, I think “heresy” is maybe a somewhat [too] polemical way to put it. Because what characterises heresy is the idea that it’s judged to be wrong. Heresy has this air of being persecuted, of being controversial. All true of Abu Zayd. But there is a whole field of spiritual experimentation, curiosity, imaginary moves that don’t try to formulate doctrine in the first place. What about them? Maybe heresy is not quite the right term for them as well. This] is what I originally called “heretic undercurrents”, as that what cannot be understood by the religious-secular binary.

Doing so relieves scholars of the obligation of defining religion and nonreligion and allows us to focus on how individuals and groups characterize themselves. It provides a neutral starting point for analyzing worldviews that is not biased toward religion, and, in so far as a case can be made that all humans must address these questions at least implicitly, it offers a basis for comparison across cultures.

Hedenius’s memory continues to loom large over religion and nonreligion in Sweden to this day.

Strategies of 'reflexive secularization’ were used to spread religious values in society through their recategorization within secular fields, allowing practitioners to partially convey the teachings and provide spiritual guidance in the form of ethical norms of behaviour. These strategies, however, seemed bound to result in a compromised negotiation: the need to detach these concepts from their religious foundations undermined the value and perceived effectiveness of missionary practice. This was stressed by Nekoda, who pinpointed a difference in “depth” (fukasa) between religion and ethics. The process of negotiation, moreover, was not unidirectional: the need to comply with constraints informing the domain of social welfare and care in Japan led practitioners to adopt a more fluid conception of missionary practice, which prioritised spreading Kōseikai values and “teaching a way of living” over the acquisition of new converts. The case of Kōseikai shows how negotiating “religion” in public spaces in Japan turns into a multidirectional process, not limited to the transmission of religious concepts and practices in nonreligious terms, but also shaping members’ own interpretation and implementation of religious practice.","religion,domain,care,japan,post,aura,febo,detail,actor,japan,employ,strategy,secularization,order,value,space,example,fieldwork,practitioner,advantage,boundary,form,expression,goal,strategy,secularization,value,society,field,practitioner,teaching,guidance,form,norm,behaviour,strategy,negotiation,need,concept,foundation,value,effectiveness,practice,nekoda,difference,depth,fukasa,religion,ethic,process,negotiation,need,constraint,domain,welfare,care,japan,practitioner,conception,practice,value,way,living,acquisition,convert,case,kōseikai,religion,space,japan,process,transmission,concept,practice,term,member,interpretation,implementation,practice"

Activist Unbelief in Canadian History,Elliot Hanowski,Independent scholar,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Canada has a long history of religious unbelief. This paper offers a social historical survey of its organized, activist forms. The radical thought of the Enlightenment was imported in the late eighteenth century, which saw Voltairean deists like Fleury Mesplet criticizing the Catholic Church in the French-speaking colony of Lower Canada. A long tradition of anticlericalism followed in Quebec even though (or because) the Church was massively influential. The rest of Canada saw freethought and rationalist movements, often organized by working-class autodidacts, developing in the nineteenth century with American and British influences. This tradition continued into the first half of the twentieth century when secularists grappled with fundamentalism and the challenge of radical politics. After World War II the language of secular humanism was deployed and organizations were run by highly educated professionals instead. The position of activist unbelief began to change as Canada shifted from being one of the Western world’s most religious countries to being one of the least in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unbelief became unremarkable, though the persistence of religion meant that the twenty-first century saw a revival of militant atheism. This survey shows that unbelief was never just a pure philosophical position but has always been shaped by the social status quo it evolved in or was opposing. Nor was opposition ever enough; activist unbelievers inevitably had to offer the undecided a vision of the secular world they were working towards, and this meant getting involved in some form of politics.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.,"unbelief,history,canada,history,unbelief,paper,survey,form,thought,enlightenment,century,deist,fleury,mesplet,church,french,colony,canada,tradition,anticlericalism,quebec,church,rest,canada,freethought,movement,class,autodidact,century,influence,tradition,half,century,secularist,fundamentalism,challenge,politic,world,war,language,humanism,organization,professional,position,unbelief,canada,world,country,half,century,unbelief,persistence,religion,century,revival,atheism,survey,unbelief,position,status,quo,opposition,unbeliever,vision,world,form,politic"

Through an ethnographic content analysis of 1,028 letters to the editor, I examine how authors frame the relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and religious faith.

Each framing results in some mixture of stigmatization and validation of atheism, literalism, and non-literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes and validates atheism and literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes non-literalism through unacknowledgment. Distancing can validate and stigmatize literalism and non-literalism, while it also results in literalism and atheism being stigmatized by putative allies.

Spirituality: Secular or Religious?,Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Galen Watts questions whether the paradigm of secularization—exemplified by the recent work of Steve Bruce—is ultimately the most useful for studying spirituality.

Thus investigating the nature of these imaginaries might prove far more fruitful than obsessing over whether or notspirituality is “real religion” or not.",2018,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"I want to consider the oft-posed question as regards spirituality: is it secular or religious? My thinking about this topic was spurred by reading Steve Bruce’s The Secular Beats the Spiritual, published last year. According to Bruce, the increased interest in “spirituality” as distinct from “religion”—evidenced by a number of polls that show the number of North Americans and Britons who identify as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR) has increased over the last two decades—does not repudiate the secularization thesis, but rather confirms it. Based on my research findings it would seem that individuals who claim “spirituality” (as well as those who reject it) do so largely as a result of the religious imaginary they hold. Like Bruce, my study participants hold their own conceptions of “religion” which inform how they define “spirituality.” Drawing attention to these varying religious imaginaries, I argue, is important, because they illuminate how individuals operationalize the “spiritual but not religious” discourse in distinct ways and for different (sometimes competing) purposes. Bruce’s substantive definition of “religion” is helpful in answering a particular kind of question, but it fails in aiding us to capture the richness of and diversity of the religious (and spiritual) imaginaries alive in Western society today.

Sovereign of Herself: Women’s Narratives of 'Lived Atheism’,Marta Trzebiatowska,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In most western societies the number of female non-believers is growing and atheism has become one manifestation of nonreligion among many (Pew Forum, 2015). However, little is known about female atheists. This article fills the gap by providing the voices of a small percentage of women who consider themselves 'practising’ but not 'active’ atheists. Through a sociological analysis of qualitative interviews with twenty self-identified atheist women I argue for the importance of researching the mundane aspects of female atheism which often fall under the radar when scholars focus predominantly on the vocal and politically active atheists. 'Lived atheism’ comprises small and seemingly insignificant actions and utterances which structure atheist women’s lives and contribute to the creation of new worldviews, symbols, and reflexive strategies. Micro-actions triggered by religious content, symbols and utterances, found in the nominally secular fabric of everyday life, add up to novel forms of gendered agency which is markedly different to outspoken activist atheism, and yet not the same as agnosticism, pure indifference, or 'none-ism’.

Increased Wellbeing from Social Interaction in a Secular Congregation,Michael E.

However, rising secularism implies that fewer people have access to these benefits. To address this problem, we investigated whether these benefits could also be obtained from membership in a secular, quasi-religious community. We conducted a longitudinal study among 92 members of the Sunday Assembly (SA), an international organization of secular congregations. SA members assemble in large services and in smaller interest groups that offer more face-to-face interaction. Once a month for six months, participants completed a questionnaire measuring wellbeing and participation in both SA and non-SA social activities. Panel analysis of longitudinal data revealed that participation in SA small-group activities positively influenced wellbeing over the six-month period, particularly among males. Participation in non-SA social activities, in contrast, had no effect on wellbeing. Aspects of the Sunday service that members perceived as most important, both for creating a sense of community and for friendship formation, were the informal socialising and cooperating that occurs before and after the service itself.

An Argument for Unbelief: A Discussion about Terminology,Nickolas Garth Conrad,University of California at Santa Cruz,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The rupture with traditional religion and the loss of belief in God as a widespread religious position represents a sea change in Western thought. However, there were very few self-declared atheists, secularists, and humanists in Western history prior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even during the Modern period, there are not many. This is especially true in my own research of nineteenth and early twentieth-century France. Those who took the name of atheist such as Baron d’Holbach or Jacques-André Naigeon were exceptional militants. The quest to find other such atheists buried in the pages and hidden messages of key books is a limited endeavor. Atheism as a concept does not originate from any single creed or doctrine and is itself open to permutation. Looking for a clear and distinct form of atheism is looking for a conceptual phenomenon constructed by the researcher. The language and words we use control and direct how we understand the past. The term “atheist” imposes a rigidity to a fluid and shifting phenomenon. Instead, we should open up our research to the emergence of modern “unbelief,” as defined by Gordon Stein and Tom Flynn in The Encyclopedia of Unbelief. This paper will argue for “unbelief” as the proper analytical category as a field of future research that will allow for a much larger, more inclusive, variegated set of parameters to understand the rupture with traditional forms of religion or spiritual practices.

Rather than trying to think them through the somewhat mystifying entity of “the secular”, he suggests that they may be understood in a clearer way as different shapes of the relationship between humans and God.

The general concept of atheism will also be discussed. The term “atheism” is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Bantō, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603–1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Bantō denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Bantō, gods were a “skillful means” created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Bantō believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Bantō, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Bantō’s “no gods” argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Bantō is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Bantō will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of “atheism” and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.,"yamagata,bantō,atheist,tokugawa,period,paper,thought,yamagata,bantō,concept,atheism,term,atheism,sense,study,atheism,japan,intellectual,atheism,merchant,scholar,yamagata,bantō,tokugawa,period,1603–1868,atheist,yume,shiro,bantō,belief,being,worldview,religion,perspective,bantō,god,mean,human,purpose,governance,belief,god,time,bantō,society,belief,need,god,form,worship,worship,obligation,ancestor,sage,bantō,way,life,standpoint,bantō,god,argument,science,neo,view,shintoist,government,bantō,intellectual,study,bantō,contribution,knowledge,category,atheism,relevance,difference,thought"

It’s employed regularly among journalists and politicians as a euphemism for 'lies,’ such as in the New Yorker’s recent headline, “Mueller’s Indictment Ends Trump Myth of the Russia 'Hoax’.” Just as commonly, myth is used to denote not outright lies, but the basing of broader narratives in prominent, but not statistically significant, events. This usage is employed by social progressives and conservatives alike, such as the myth of the Muslim terrorist or the myth of white privilege. In these cases, the use of myth is associated with the rise of grassroots media. Yet another usage of myth regards religious narratives: in this case, it is the events themselves, rather than their statistical significance that is called into question. Here myth is cast as an age-old problem yet to be removed from the modern psyche. Ill-defined as they are, these usages share a common thread: myths are dangerous, sometimes pernicious things that go against key principles on which modernity is founded.","myth,solidarity,world,introduction,world,myth,news,gut,consensus,university,mind,myth,role,myth,action,book,myth,solidarity,world,division,light,role,group,sharing,myth,space,introduction,book,myth,term,journalist,politician,euphemism,lie,yorker,headline,mueller,indictment,trump,myth,russia,hoax,myth,lie,basing,narrative,event,usage,progressive,conservative,myth,terrorist,myth,privilege,case,use,myth,rise,medium,usage,myth,narrative,case,event,significance,question,myth,age,problem,psyche,usage,thread,myth,thing,principle,modernity"

Mediating 'Religious’ and 'Non-Religious’ Spaces: A Cultural Expression of a Japanese Religion in Postwar France,Masato Kato,SOAS University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will explore the roles that cultural representations can play in mediating the 'religious’ and 'non-religious’ spaces through the case of a Japanese religion operating in postwar France. Boundaries between religious and non-religious spaces are often contested and negotiated by relevant social actors and institutions, as evinced by recent scholarship on religions in the public sphere. Not much has been discussed so far, however, as to how representations and institutional activities associated with a certain culture can mediate the two spaces by translating the religious representations and messages into the cultural counterparts. To highlight this dynamic, this paper will highlight the case of a Japanese religion known as Tenrikyō as it operates in postwar France. Tenrikyō’s propagation in France is characterised by its two-tier yet legally separate institutional structure involving 'religious’ and 'cultural’ associations—an institutional demarcation necessitated by the French legal framework relating to the 1901 and 1905 laws. In the course of promoting cultural activities as a way to increase the visibility and legitimacy of the name Tenri in the French public, Tenrikyō has at times the reinterpretation process but is not a sufficient explanation for the radical used representations and activities associated with Japan in ways that allow messages and representations that are otherwise confined to religious spaces to go beyond the boundaries thereof.

Reinterpreting sacred experiences: Examining how exposure to global and historical diversity can transform an individual's meaning system,James Murphy,South Dakota State University,South Dakota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Experiences that are deemed spiritual or sacred often play an important role in both creating and sustaining religious beliefs but the way that these experiences are subsequently interpreted by individuals who have left religious worldviews is underexplored. This paper presents a case study that explores how an individual who previously experienced many vivid and powerful spiritual experiences came to question the ontological nature of those experiences and eventually reject his previous beliefs about them. Doing so involved the transformation of a deeply held meaning system and a radical change in self-identity, from charismatic-evangelical Christian to secular Humanist. A key element of this transformative process was exposure to accounts of similar experiences from other faiths and competing explanatory worldviews, both historical and contemporary. This exposure to other worldviews was an important part of transformation of his worldview. It is suggested that other important factors included his academic training in scientific method and critical thinking, positive personal relationships with people from contrasting cultures, and both a strong commitment to truth and a confidence in his own judgement that were the result of his prior faith and experiences. The confluence of particular intellectual, social and cultural influences led to the transformation of his beliefs and this personal context is critical to understanding the changes he experienced.

The “Religious” and “Secular” Nature of Self-Spirituality: Insights from the Field,Galen Watts,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as “spiritual but not religious” (SBNR). Paul Heelas (1996) has deemed the emerging religio-cultural form underpinning this moniker, “selfspirituality,” as it sacralizes the self. Upon completing semi-structured interviews with twenty Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR conducted between 2014-2015, I found the discourse of self-spirituality to be informed by four core ethics: the ethic of self-responsibility, the ethic of authenticity, the ethic of productivity and the ethic of self-awareness (Watts 2015). Drawing from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork conducted at three different sites in downtown Toronto—a Toastmaster’s meeting, a Twelve-Step group (Alcoholics Anonymous), and an evangelical church (C3)—I argue that the discourse of self-spirituality can be found, in strikingly similar forms, in each. In other words, despite the ostensible differences between these three organizations they, in fact, endorse quite similar conceptions of the self, as well as, respectively, preach a moral message of self-empowerment, which is tied to an expressive individualism. By presenting data derived from field notes and informal interviews, in tandem with formal documents produced by the organizations themselves, I aim to challenge the commonplace view that so-called religious spaces (i.e. evangelical churches), spiritual spaces (i.e. AA), and secular spaces (i.e. Toastmaster’s) are inherently different, as well as problematize the notion that emic categories such as “religious,” “not religious” and “spiritual but not religious” necessarily reflect vastly different conceptions of the self and the good life.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"nature,self,spirituality,insight,field,quarter,century,number,north,american,affiliation,self,sbnr,paul,heelas,form,moniker,self,interview,millennial,self,sbnr,discourse,self,spirituality,core,ethic,ethic,self,responsibility,ethic,authenticity,ethic,productivity,ethic,self,awareness,watts,fieldwork,site,downtown,toronto,toastmaster,meeting,step,group,alcoholic,church,c3)—i,discourse,self,spirituality,form,word,difference,organization,fact,conception,self,message,self,empowerment,individualism,datum,field,note,interview,tandem,document,organization,view,space,i.e.,church,space,i.e.,space,i.e.,toastmaster,notion,category,conception,self,life"
"Occupation, Generational Memory and 'Secular’ Self-Talk: the case of Generation Y Jewish-Israelis",Stacey Gutkowski,King’s College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper sheds light on one aspect of the complex process whereby post-Oslo modalities of Occupation have been absorbed into self-narratives of one Jewish-Israeli social group: young hilonim ('secular Jews’) who came of age in the 2000s. Through a close reading of three interviews with young hilonim from across the political spectrum, it highlights one important but hitherto unappreciated aspect of collective generational memory which has primed their understanding of themselves as 'reasonable people.’ Using new fieldwork and survey data, it hypothesizes two things: first, that young hilonim have been susceptible to Likud-led governments’ strategies of legitimizing Occupation through what Van Leeuwen calls discursive 'rationalization;’ second, that hiloni habitus 'priming’ at a formative age has played some as-yet unappreciated role in this. The paper focuses on this 'priming’ process during the 2000s and 2010s. It discusses the case of hilonim in light of the comparative literature on 'secular Judaism,’ proposing a new theoretical approach for its study.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"occupation,memory,self,talk,case,generation,israeli,paper,light,aspect,process,modality,occupation,self,narrative,group,hilonim,jew,age,2000,reading,interview,hilonim,spectrum,aspect,memory,understanding,people,fieldwork,survey,datum,thing,hilonim,likud,government,strategy,occupation,van,leeuwen,rationalization,second,habitus,priming,age,role,paper,priming,process,2000,2010,case,hilonim,light,literature,judaism,approach,study"

These different approaches and meanings to being a religious none are influenced by a range of variables including one’s pathway into saying they have no religion (e.g. irreligious socialization versus disaffiliation), as well as the social environment that one lives in (e.g. in a high versus low religious setting). Drawing on extensive survey data in the United States and Canada, as well as interview data with thirty religious nones in Calgary, Canada, we offer a sociological exploration into the heterogeneity among religious nones in North America. We focus on a continuum of five types of nones, based on the dimensions of belief and behaviour: involved seculars, inactive non-believers, inactive believers, spiritual but not religious, and church involved believers. In doing so, we examine the diversity of relationships that religious nones’ have or do not have with organized religion, personalized or group spiritualties, non-religion and non-belief, as well as organized secular communities. We give attention to how and why these respective groups have grown or declined over time, as well as where and why they are strongly or weakly represented (nationally and regionally).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"religiosity,spirituality,secularity,none,state,canada,diversity,belief,behaviour,group,tradition,approach,meaning,range,variable,pathway,religion,socialization,disaffiliation,environment,setting,survey,datum,state,canada,interview,datum,none,calgary,canada,exploration,heterogeneity,none,north,america,continuum,type,none,dimension,belief,behaviour,secular,non,believer,believer,church,believer,diversity,relationship,none,religion,group,spiritualty,belief,community,attention,group,time"
Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in the Existence of God(s),Nick Stauner,Case Western Reserve University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although many studies have examined predictors of belief and nonbelief in the existence of god(s), and many theories have surmised implicit reasons for individual differences in theistic beliefs, people’s subjective, explicit reasons for belief or nonbelief have different content. We studied these reasons in large surveys of U.S. adults (undergraduates and Internet-based samples). We examined reasons for nonbelief and belief: intellectual, relational, emotional (positive and negative), intuitive, experiential, socialization-based, and prior experiences with religion. Intellectual reasons predominated among nonbelievers; however, nonbelievers endorsed all reasons somewhat. These results contrasted with reasons for theistic belief, which distributed more equally across categories and averaged high levels of endorsement. Many reasons for nonbelief correlated with more ultimate meaning struggle and search for meaning, but only relational and agnostic reasons correlated with presence of meaning. These results highlight the diversity and importance of self-reported reasons behind people’s beliefs about the existence of God. Additional planned analyses will explore the potential for differences among self-described atheists, agnostics, the spiritual but not religious, and others who report no religious affiliation. No specific differences are anticipated, but any that result will be tested for replicability across multiple samples. This research will seek to explore the implications of nonreligious identities beyond their overt meanings regarding nonbelief in god(s).

They are popular among part of population that might be characterized as „spiritual but not religious“ (Willard, Norenzayan 2017) – people who are not affiliated to traditional (Christian) church, and even have negative opinion about it, but who seek for different kind of spiritual experiences. As Willard and Norenzayan pointed out, „spiritual but not religious“ has „an experiential relationship to the supernatural, and see themselves more connected to the universe as a whole“. Although collective therapies are quite popular at the moment, scholars only partly focus on them. These therapies contain elements of rituals, dance, sharing narratives and personal experiences, and may be charged with different kind of emotions. Here, I will present data from my field (qualitative) research and, combining classical theories of ritual (Durkheim, Malinowski) with psychological theories, I will analyze 1) motives for searching for this kind of experience, 2) try to explain what function they may have and why is group important in this context and, 3) what is the role of emotions in this context.

Eco-spirituality promotes environmentalism similarly in atheists and religious individuals,Adam Baimel,University of British Columbia,Canada,M,Catherine Li,University of British Columbia,Canada,F,Ara Norenzayan,University of British Columbia,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Atheists may denounce belief in and the importance of god(s) in their lives, but this does not necessarily suggest that they are completely free from other forms of supernatural beliefs that have direct consequences on their attitudes and behaviours.

(e.g., belief in 'gaia’ and their tendencies to anthropomorphize the natural world), a diverse set of attitudinal measures regarding climate change related issues, and a set of novel measures assessing sacred value orientations to protecting the environment. We find that although individuals who do not believe in god(s) do score lower on supernatural eco-spiritual beliefs than believers individuals, they do not reject these beliefs to the same extent as they do belief in god(s). And importantly, these types of beliefs have similar downstream consequences in both groups in predicting attitudinal concern for, moralization of, pro-environmental behaviours (including actual green charity donations) and sacred value orientations towards the issue of protecting the natural world.

Pillay,University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The relative infancy of South Africa as a constitutional state based on the rule of law, has brought issues of secularism and the relationship between religion and State into sharp focus. In a socio-historical context in which religious normativity and the privileging of religion have gone largely uncontested, it is increasingly evident that the previously suppressed voices of the non-religious is enjoying recognition, within a Post-1994 constitutional framework which strikes a delicate balance between the separation of religion from matters of State, on the one hand, and the accommodation of religion in the social life of the country on the other. In dialogue, primarily, with the bodies of works of Tala Asad and Charles Taylor, particularly Formations of the Secular and The Secular Age, respectively, this paper aims to explore the socio-legal and constitutional standing of South Africans who choose not to ascribe to any faith-based religious position. By contrasting the country’s jurisprudence legacy under Apartheid, against the development of specific case law within a new constitutional framework a set of arguments will be advanced to outline the new social contracts in support of the rights and obligations of the non-religious which were previously threatened and/or suppressed. Whilst this changed socio-legal and constitutional environment may make for a more positive outlook for non-religion and unbelief in South Africa it is also evident that, as opposed to the treatment that these crucial subjects have already received in the 'global north’ they remain largely academically unexplored in South Africa and Africa.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"religion,secularism,context,dialogue,talal,asad,charles,taylor,infancy,africa,state,rule,law,issue,secularism,relationship,religion,state,focus,context,normativity,privileging,religion,voice,recognition,framework,balance,separation,religion,matter,state,hand,accommodation,religion,life,country,dialogue,body,work,tala,asad,charles,taylor,formation,age,paper,socio,standing,african,faith,position,country,jurisprudence,legacy,apartheid,development,case,law,framework,set,argument,contract,support,right,obligation,environment,outlook,religion,unbelief,africa,treatment,subject,north,africa,africa"
Is Confucianism a Cultural Civil Religion?,Rogelio Leal Benavides,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For over two-millennia, the teachings and philosophies of Confucianism have shaped and influenced the moral attitudes and socio-political organisation of the Chinese people and other East Asian societies. Its contemporary revival has risen debates in academic circles on whether it is likely to reposition itself as a code or system of social ethics that could have a major impact in the region and consequently at a global scale. Modernised Confucian values can transform China’s existing state of affairs and become an intellectual and cultural resource to prompt a civil religion in the region with Confucian characteristics. This essay discusses the various dimensions of Confucianism in modern China and East Asia concluding that certain ethical, political, and philosophical components of the tradition—including some of its quasi-religious aspects—could be reconstructed and legitimately implemented as a dominant set of principles that can regulate institutions and mediate people’s behaviours. The constitution of a cultural civil religion is tied to morality, justice, and other precepts committed to social order, political stability, and righteous modes of governance.

The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and the Categories of 'Religion(s)’ and 'Secularity’,Mitsutoshi Horii,Shumei University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The English term 'religion’ first arrived in Japan in the 1850’s, and became established as a social category by the 1880s. At this point, the category of religion denoted specifically Buddhism, sectarian Shinto, and Christianity. The realm of ostensibly 'non-religious’ national ethos of that time can be conceptualised as 'Shinto Secular’ (e.g. Josephson 2012). When Japan surrendered to the Allied powers at the end of the brutal Pacific War, in 1945, the pre-war 'Shinto Secular’ was quickly reconceptualised as 'State Shinto,’ and reclassified as 'religion.’ This signifies the construction of a new type of secularity, which replaced the former 'Shinto’ type. This paper examines the foundation of the post-war Japanese secularity through the critical reading of William Woodard’s The Allied Occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and Japanese Religions (1972) as well as historical documents from the Occupation. What constitutes post-war Japanese secularity was strongly shaped by the value orientation of American liberal democracy. Importantly, it is the discourse on religion, as binary opposite of liberal democratic 'secularity,’ that naturalises the liberal democratic value orientations as if they represent the order of things and that equate the cultural norms of liberal democracy to natural reason. Thus, the reclassification of post-war 'religion’ played an important role in constructing and authorising the post-war secularity. It is this which constitutes the governing norms of contemporary Japan.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"occupation,japan,category,religion(s,secularity,term,religion,japan,category,1880,point,category,religion,buddhism,shinto,christianity,realm,ethos,time,e.g.,josephson,japan,power,end,war,shinto,state,shinto,religion,construction,type,secularity,shinto,type,paper,foundation,secularity,reading,william,woodard,occupation,japan,religion,document,occupation,secularity,value,orientation,democracy,discourse,religion,opposite,secularity,value,orientation,order,thing,norm,democracy,reason,religion,role,secularity,norm,japan"
A Secular Age in Modern India? Jawaharlal Nehru and the Question of Indian Secularity,Sushimita Nath,Jawaharlal Nehru University,India,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Jawaharlal Nehru’s modern and secular vision directly shaped independent India’s polity and society for seventeen years; initially heading the interim legislature (1947-52) and thereafter winning three successive general elections (1952, 1957, 1961). In the Nehruvian period the Indian polity and society saw an emphasis on state-led developmentalism, scientific temper, and a commitment to secularism. In this paper, I shall elaborate upon Nehru’s notion of secularity and his idea of secularism by identifying two dialectical strands of arguments in his reflection on the role of religion in state and society under modern conditions. One argument of secularity, I argue, can be located in his nationalist narrative about its cultural familiarity and suitability for the Indian society; and the other argument relies on the origin and success of secularity in the West and hence its emulation and desirability in modern India. I call the first secularity narrative 'the secular nationalist strand,’ and the second, 'the liberal-Western strand.’ I shall argue that both these strands of arguments were brought together by Nehru to construct a narrative of Indian secularity and to also argue that secularity as such is an universalisable ideal. Following Nehru’s narrative of secularity, I identify three features of Nehruvian secularism and also argue that the withering of Nehruvian type of secularism in contemporary India may be partially attributed to its inability to accommodate democratic politics that, since the 1980s, has been increasingly focussing on religious and other identarian issues, like caste.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"age,india,jawaharlal,nehru,question,secularity,jawaharlal,nehru,vision,india,polity,society,year,legislature,election,period,polity,society,emphasis,state,temper,commitment,secularism,paper,nehru,notion,secularity,idea,secularism,strand,argument,reflection,role,religion,state,society,condition,argument,secularity,narrative,familiarity,suitability,society,argument,origin,success,secularity,west,emulation,desirability,india,secularity,narrative,strand,strand,strand,argument,nehru,narrative,secularity,secularity,ideal,nehru,narrative,secularity,feature,secularism,withering,type,secularism,india,inability,politic,1980,issue,caste"
Islam as Religion and Secularity: Expressing a modern conceptual distinction from within a discursive tradition,Florian Zemmin,University of Bern,Switzerland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Muslims and non-Muslims alike often take Islam to be a religion that is more than just religion, to contain both the religious and the secular. This understanding, it should be clear, cannot possibly form part of an asserted timeless Islamic essence, since it only became meaningful once the modern conceptual pair of religion and the secular was operative (even though we may in hindsight retrace kernels of that pair to earlier historical moments). This paper attends to the formative period of the modern conceptual order in Arabic to show that Islam indeed came to refer to religion and the secular, but that this double reference of Islam could and can be used to validate the integration as well as the distinction of both spheres. Islamic intellectuals in the modern public sphere answered to the ubiquitous question concerning the relation of these two spheres by appropriating the Islamic discursive tradition to address both religion and the secular. Within this discursive arrangement, they could argue for varying degrees and points of distinction and connection between religion and the secular. I base my argument mainly on an analysis of the journal al-Manar, the widely influential mouthpiece of Islamic modernism that was published in Cairo between 1898 and 1940. I complement this by looking at secular actors who in the context of al-Manar validated Islam as culture and thereby contributed to the double reference of Islam to religion and the secular.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"islam,religion,secularity,distinction,tradition,muslim,non,muslim,islam,religion,religion,understanding,essence,pair,religion,hindsight,kernel,pair,moment,paper,period,order,islam,religion,reference,islam,integration,distinction,sphere,intellectual,sphere,question,relation,sphere,tradition,religion,arrangement,degree,point,distinction,connection,religion,argument,analysis,journal,manar,mouthpiece,modernism,cairo,actor,context,manar,islam,culture,reference,islam,religion"

What possible meaning can the post-secular have?,Timothy Jones,King's College London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The disputed term 'post-secular’ is used as a descriptor for multiple ideas in diverse fields of research. If there is a commonality, it is that the term carries the implicit assertion that there is a particular 'secular' which has been 'transcended', immediately begging the questions of the particularisation of the secular and what form this transcendence is supposed to take. In his 2012 presidential address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, James Beckford critically appraised contemporary uses of the term, concluding that ""the literature on the postsecular is shot through with uncertainty about the question of whether it refers to a concept or a reality."" Beckford sketched six groups of interpretation, which ranged from denial and apathy to zealous claims of the reintroduction of the transcendent into public dialogue. This paper revisits the theme of the post-secular, seeking to interrogate the term in the context of the dialectical relationships of religion / non-religion and secular / eternal.

"Contesting the 'Islamic' in Islamic Revival: Women Practicing Islamic Visual Arts in Istanbul, Turkey",Hülya Arik,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Questions pertaining to what is “Islamic” and what counts as “traditional” have gained more salience in the post-secular moment, with the unprecedented rise of Islamist movements around the globe. Behind these popular movements are not only political parties and grassroots organizing, but also the reinvigoration of a repertoire of cultural forms, images and historic references that add meaning to what constitutes “Islamic” in socially specific and gendered ways. This paper explores the cultural formations of Islamic revivalism in Turkey with a focus on the Islamic visual arts scene in Istanbul and from the perspective of women artists. Since the 1990s, Islamic visual arts have flourished at an unparalleled scale parallel to the rise of the pro-Islamist politics in Turkey. This creative practice has revived the aesthetic and ethical values, as well as histories, abandoned under the hegemony of Western culture since the early days of the republic, and contributed to the ongoing crisis and fragmentation of the vernacular secularism in Turkey. Importantly, increasing numbers of women artists have participated in this traditionally male-dominated art scene as they came to learn, teach and practice traditional art forms such as miniature, illumination, and calligraphy. In this art scene, artists, instructors, curators, directors, gallery owners and patrons come together to redefine the meaning of “Islamic” and negotiate the cultural boundaries of pursuing Sunni Islam, as well as breaking away from it. This research examines the Islamic and traditional art scene in Turkey as a complex counter-hegemonic space in the context of Islamic revivalism in response the dominant discourses of secularism and Islam in Turkey. It particularly looks at how women artists negotiate and reproduce the notion of “Islamic” and thereby challenge the patriarchal constructions of secularist and religious discourses.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"revival,woman,art,istanbul,turkey,question,salience,moment,rise,movement,globe,movement,party,grassroot,organizing,reinvigoration,repertoire,form,image,reference,meaning,way,paper,formation,revivalism,turkey,focus,art,scene,istanbul,perspective,woman,artist,1990,art,scale,rise,politic,turkey,practice,value,history,hegemony,culture,day,republic,crisis,fragmentation,secularism,turkey,number,woman,artist,male,art,scene,art,form,illumination,calligraphy,art,scene,artist,instructor,curator,director,gallery,owner,patron,meaning,boundary,islam,research,art,scene,turkey,space,context,revivalism,response,discourse,secularism,islam,turkey,woman,artist,notion,construction,discourse"
Growing Up Nonreligious: The Intra–Regionality of Children’s Unbeliefs,Rachael Shillitoe,University of York,England,F,Anna Strhan,University of York,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper presents preliminary findings from an ethnographic project exploring how, when, where, and with whom children learn to be unbelieving, and how they experience and negotiate their unbeliefs across everyday school and family life. As numbers of the avowedly nonreligious continue to rise in Western Europe and North America, particularly among younger age cohorts, this research advances our understanding of nonreligion and unbelief through addressing what it means to be unbelieving for children. Drawing on comparative fieldwork across three contrasting geographical 'microclimates’ of religion and nonreligion in the UK (Voas and McAndrew 2012), our project explores the everyday lived realities of children’s unbelief, and how this is experienced, performed and negotiated in relation to the times and spaces of school and home, and across different geographical settings. Our paper will focus particular attention on regional contingencies shaping children’s forms of unbelief, their values, and worldviews across the project’s three field sites located in urban, suburban and rural areas of the south west, north and north-west of England.

"What’s Love Got to Do With It? An Exploratory Study of Religious Nones Experiences With Dating, Relationships and Marriage",Robin Allen,Boise State University,Idaho,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A few years ago the author was completing a qualitative project with in-depth interviews of religious nones. A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives (Hwang, 2013; Morgan, 2013). There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting (Ecklund & Lee, 2011; Manning, 2013). However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships.

"Insights into the Experiences, Stability and Nature of Unbelief for Older Adults in the UK: Regional Perspectives",Joanna Malone,University of Kent,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the role that regional specificity plays in the experience, understanding and significance of unbelief for older adults living in the UK. Voas and McAndrew’s (2012) research 'Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain’ coins the phrase 'microclimates’ to highlight the disparities found across Britain when looking at Census data on religious affiliation. By taking a regional specific approach the research hopes to uncover whether the non-religiosity of older adults differs depending on the region in which they live and/or grew up as well as taking into account other intersectional influences in their lives. This paper draws on of ongoing doctoral research which will qualitatively explore the nature of unbelief for older adults from a range of different ethnic and social backgrounds, and who do not participate in a nonreligious organisation in the UK. Specifically, the research aims to investigate the life histories of older adults in relation to their unbelief (including their backgrounds, childhood, religious background), the significance and expression of unbelief in older adults’ everyday lives and the implication of their unbelief in relation to specific life events (e.g. education, relationships, family, illness, death, loss).",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"insight,experience,stability,nature,unbelief,adult,perspective,paper,role,specificity,experience,understanding,significance,unbelief,adult,voa,mcandrew,research,puzzle,religion,britain,phrase,microclimate,disparity,britain,census,datum,affiliation,approach,research,non,religiosity,adult,region,account,influence,life,paper,research,nature,unbelief,adult,range,background,organisation,research,life,history,adult,relation,unbelief,background,childhood,background,significance,expression,unbelief,adult,everyday,life,implication,unbelief,relation,life,event,e.g.,education,relationship,family,illness,death,loss"
The maintenance of extinctivism in the face of challenging experiences,Jamin Halberstadt,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although motivational theories in the field emphasize the importance of defending religious beliefs, our previous research suggests that unbelief, for some people, is an equally coherent and functional worldview, which they will be highly motivated to defend. To study such defense, we developed a semi-structured interview to characterize events that challenge nonbelievers’ worldviews. In a pilot study involving over 200 American and New Zealand participants (mostly religious skeptics), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events that it could not. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the nature and frequency of these challenging events, and how they are reconciled with existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we established a framework for classifying participants’ experiences, as well as their strategies for defending their worldviews. Overall 33% (n=238) of extinctivists reported having had experiences that challenged their afterlife beliefs. The most frequently reported type of experience involved encounters with ghosts or spirits. Other categories included: near death experiences, out of body experiences, unexplainable dreams, religious experiences, precognitions, and hallucinations. The majority of participants reconciled these experiences with their extinctivist worldview by attributing them to cognitive failings or flights of imagination.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"maintenance,extinctivism,face,experience,theory,field,importance,belief,research,unbelief,people,worldview,defense,interview,event,nonbeliever,worldview,study,zealand,participant,skeptic,claim,phenomenon,science,participant,science,event,follow,extinctivist,people,soul,body,nature,frequency,event,view,afterlife,combination,coding,framework,participant,experience,strategy,worldview,n=238,extinctivist,experience,afterlife,belief,type,experience,encounter,ghost,spirit,category,death,experience,body,experience,dream,experience,precognition,hallucination,majority,participant,experience,extinctivist,worldview,failing,flight,imagination"
The Anatomy of Unbelief: Cognitive Science of Religion and Secularization,Mari Ovsepyan,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"'The road atlases of belief versus disbelief and religion versus secularism, provide maps that are much neater and tidier than the spaces in which we find ourselves,' writes James Smith (2014). In this paper I explore the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) approaches to nonreligion and unbelief and challenge their strong focus on 'the absence’ of belief in supernatural agency. I compare the way in which CSR scholars have approached unbelief in the past to the traditional secularization theories and the 'hermeneutical project’ criticised by Mahmood (2006) for its secularised conception of religion understood as 'an abstracted category of beliefs and doctrines.’ Together with Geertz (2010) and Smith (2014) who come against the 'religion for the disembodied minds’, I argue for the importance of developing a biocultural theory of religion, which is based on an expanded view of cognition anchored both in the brain and the body, and extended beyond the borders of individual brains. I develop a cognitive approach to non-religion and unbelief focused on 'the presence' rather than 'the absence’ of belief, drawing the parallels between the concept of 'implicit beliefs’, central to CSR and Talal Asad’s, Saba Machmood’s and Charles Taylor’s notions of 'implicit religion,' 'background sense,' 'deep/ background grammars,' 'commitments,' 'attachments,' and 'schesis’. I argue that such an approach would uniquely accommodate contemporary biological, social and cognitive sciences and provide a way forward for future CSR studies.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"anatomy,unbelief,science,religion,secularization,road,atlas,belief,disbelief,religion,secularism,map,space,james,smith,paper,science,religion,csr,approach,nonreligion,unbelief,focus,absence,belief,agency,way,csr,scholar,unbelief,past,secularization,theory,project,mahmood,conception,religion,category,belief,doctrine,geertz,smith,religion,mind,importance,theory,religion,view,cognition,brain,body,border,brain,approach,religion,unbelief,presence,absence,belief,parallel,concept,belief,csr,talal,asad,saba,machmood,charles,taylor,notion,religion,background,sense,background,grammar,commitment,attachment,schesis,approach,science,way,csr,study"
Secular versus religious worldviews: Do they fulfil the same psychological functions?,Valerie van Mulukom,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A global increase in individuals who do not hold religious beliefs, and a concurrent increase in secular organisations and even secular rituals (e.g., humanist weddings and funerals), begs for a better understanding of what unbelief entails. Unbelief can be defined as a negative phenomenon, as lacking in religious beliefs, but we argue that non-believers still hold distinct ontological, epistemological and ethical beliefs about reality. We hypothesise that like religious beliefs, such secular beliefs will have profound effects at cognitive, motivational, and emotional levels. Specifically, this project investigates in two studies whether such secular beliefs –organised in worldviews like religious beliefs– have similar psychological functions to religious beliefs, such as providing sources of meaning or coping mechanisms. Study 1 comprises of a systematic review of the current literature on psychological functions of secular beliefs and worldviews. In study 2, the range of psychological functions of secular beliefs will be further investigated through cross-cultural surveys in the UK, Denmark, and Turkey. Study 2 will be an ongoing project until the summer of 2019, but preliminary results will be presented.

Multi-faced Religiosity: Negotiating shinkō (faith) and shūkyō (religion) in the secularised space of social welfare in Japan,Aura Di Febo,University of Manchester,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent scholarship on Japan addressed the historical process through which the category of religion was constructed through a “politically charged boundary-drawing exercise” (Josephson 2012) that codified its position vis-a-vis the 'secular’, resulting in a twofold differentiation running along the private-public divide. The separation between interior beliefs and their external manifestations intertwined with a discrimination of legitimacy between different forms of religiosity, such as commitment to a specific system of doctrine and practice versus non-denominational forms of religiosity partially admitted in the public space (Nishimura 2016). This process, far from resulting in a univocal definition of 'religion’, produced a multi-layered fragmentation which still marks this conceptual field of shinkō/shūkyō. Focusing on welfare activities promoted by the lay-Buddhist organisation Risshō Kōseikai, the paper will discuss how legal constraints and social conventions shape the way practitioners articulate their religiosity when operating in the secularised domain of social care. The need to comply with existing limitations leads to the adoption of strategies of “discursive secularization” (Rots 2017) through which members reformulate their engagement in neutral, less religiously-connoted terms. However, as boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate expressions of religiosity are not clearly drawn, the process is often accompanied by confusion and uneasiness in both practitioners and non-religious actors. The analysis aims to offer new insights not only on the process through which 'religion’ and 'the secular’ came to be constructed in Japan, but also on the ways in which these categories are experienced 'on the ground’ by religious practitioners operating in secularised spaces.

The agent architectures in our model will include micro-level variables such as “ontological confusion,” “intelligence,” and “analytic thinking,” as well as macro-level variables such as “educational access,” “existential security,” and “political freedom.” Computer modeling and simulation methodologies provide a unique way of “particularizing” worldviews because they allow us to alter parameters within the state space of an artificial society, and explore how naturally evolved cognitive dispositions can be evoked in different ways in various cultural contexts.

Understanding Nonbelief in Egypt,Karin van Nieuwkerk,Radbound University,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Nonbelief is a highly sensitive and controversial topic at this particular moment in Egypt. The conceptual binary of religion and non-religion – regardless of the nature and variety of the nonbelievers’ worldview - militant atheism, discrete unbelief and skepticism, humanism, and even secularism - is politicized and mobilized in (social) media outlets. Yet particularly after the 2011 revolution, many - particularly young people - are searching within and beyond the religious tradition in which they were raised for sources of inspiration to fashion their worldview, including more orthodox forms of religion, Sufism, New Age, and varieties of unbelief. Particularly the latter is a great source of 'moral panic’. On the one hand, the assumed growing number of atheists is blamed on, and used to combat, 'extremist’ forms of religion. On the other hand, due to the hardened opposition between religion and non-religion, most nonbelievers who dare to speak out embrace a rather militant anti-religion discourse, leading to fierce debates and clashes in the (social) media. This paper, however, will try to uncover the different forms and experiences of doubt and unbelief. In addition to You Tube channels and other (social) media outlets, the paper is based on ongoing fieldwork and interviews in Egypt. I will use an intersectional approach by comparing the understanding and experiences of men and women, Muslims and Copts with religious doubts and non-belief. Taking a dynamic approach and without assuming (non)religion is a priori a 'thick identity’, I will detail the various trajectories of Egyptian skeptics and non-believers.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"nonbelief,egypt,nonbelief,topic,moment,egypt,binary,religion,religion,nature,variety,nonbeliever,worldview,atheism,unbelief,skepticism,humanism,secularism,medium,outlet,revolution,people,tradition,source,inspiration,worldview,form,religion,sufism,age,variety,unbelief,source,panic,hand,number,atheist,form,religion,hand,opposition,religion,religion,nonbeliever,discourse,debate,clash,medium,paper,form,experience,doubt,unbelief,addition,tube,channel,medium,outlet,paper,fieldwork,interview,egypt,approach,understanding,experience,man,woman,muslim,copt,doubt,non,belief,approach,non)religion,priori,identity,trajectory,skeptic,non,believer"
The Role of the Press in the Evolution of Secularism in the Arab World: The Case of al-Jinān (1870-1886),Mohammad Magout,University of Leipzig,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism in the Arab World is a topic that has received wide scholarly attention, yet not many works have looked closely at its early evolution and the historical conditions of its emergence in the second half of the 19th C. The main historical narrative in this regard explains the formation of Arab secular thought as a reaction by a number of Christian intellectuals in the Levant against Muslim Ottoman rule. While the earliest expressions of secularism in the Arab world were indeed made by Christians, one cannot simply reduce their views to minoritarian politics. Such a narrative ignores several other important factors, such as the diverse attitudes of Arab Christians toward modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire and internal dynamics within Christian minorities, which witnessed intense debates and competitions, not only along confessional lines, but also socioeconomic and political; for example, between the clergy and the rising bourgeois laity. Within these debates and discussions, the newly emerging Arabic press played a crucial role in the formation, development, and dissemination of secular epistemic, social, and political categories. In this proposed paper, I shall examine this aspect taking al-Jinān journal (1870- 1886) as an example. Published in Beirut by Syrian intellectual and Protestant convert Butrus al-Bustani, al-Jinān was one of the earliest long-running and widely circulated periodicals in the Arab world. It followed a political line that supported Ottoman modernization, but was more explicit in grounding these reforms in notions of human progress and spirit of the age. Its political line will be contrasted with those of two other contemporary Beirut-based journals— al-Bashīr (published by the Jesuits) and Thamarāt al-Funūn (published by Islamic reformists)—in order to provide a picture of the ideological and political climate at the time.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"role,press,evolution,secularism,world,case,jinān,secularism,world,topic,attention,work,evolution,condition,emergence,half,narrative,regard,formation,thought,reaction,number,intellectual,levant,ottoman,rule,expression,secularism,world,christian,view,politic,narrative,factor,attitude,christian,modernization,effort,ottoman,empire,dynamic,minority,debate,competition,line,example,clergy,bourgeois,laity,debate,discussion,press,role,formation,development,dissemination,category,paper,aspect,jinān,journal,1870-,example,beirut,butrus,bustani,jinān,periodical,world,line,ottoman,modernization,reform,notion,progress,spirit,age,line,beirut,journal,bashīr,jesuit,thamarāt,funūn,picture,climate,time"

The project Cultural Conflict 2.0 investigates how social media tends to reproduce social order rather than – as it is often assumed – providing platforms for construing one’s own identities and breaking down social barriers. Drawing partly on the figurational sociology of Norbert Elias, this paper presents data from an ongoing investigation of the “established” and “outsiders” in Kristiansand, and the reproduction of these categories in various social media. Among Kristiansand’s 'outsiders’ are young former members of local conservative Christian congregations. The mediated (and not) performances of this loosely defined group provides a case study in how non-religious identities and networked communities are construed not (only) based on explicit rejection of religion, but also in negotiation with a particular social order that happens to carry locally specific 'religious’ overtones.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"ex-,outsider,bible,belt,city,kristiansand,capital,norway,bible,belt,centre,region,degree,profession,practice,order,associate,status,power,christianity,family,structure,project,conflict,medium,order,platform,identity,barrier,sociology,norbert,elias,paper,datum,investigation,outsider,kristiansand,reproduction,category,medium,kristiansand,outsider,member,congregation,performance,group,case,study,identity,community,rejection,religion,negotiation,order,overtone"

Secular magic: vanishing others in a secular age,Marek Sullivan,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The theme of this conference—'secularisms’—suggests we know what we are looking for. But if the critical study of secularism or 'the secular’ during the last twenty years has shown one thing, it is secularism’s profound multivalence even (and perhaps especially) in the West. There are multiple ways of approaching secularism and the secular: as a mode of law (Hurd; Sullivan; Pellegrini), a core facet of late-modern subjectivity (Taylor; Asad), a political ideology (Fitzgerald), an obfuscating mythology of the religious other (Cavanaugh). Which should be foregrounded in a search for 'other’ secularisms? What preconceptions condition the line we draw around our anticipated object of study? Can we 'provincialise’ the Western secular simply by locating other secularisms in other cultures? In this paper, I use my current research on the limitations (and failures) of an eminently Western study—Charles Taylor’s A secular age (2007)—as a cautionary tale about examining the secular from within the secular. For although Taylor appears to shine an objective light on what has brought us to our current 'secular age’, he still writes out of a set of coordinates driven by Eurocentric, secular self-understandings that do not recognise the profound role 'other’ religions have already played in the construction of Western secularity (Brown 2007; Mahmood 2010; Casanova 2010).

Reaching for a New Sense of Connection? The Diversity of Unbelief in Northern and Central Europe — An Early Analysis,David Herbert,Kingston University of London,England,M,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Surveys shows that unbelievers have a distinctive profile compared to the general population on several indicators related to sociality, collective identity and cultural transmission. For example, they tend to rank family as less important, to identify less with people for whom tradition is important, and to be less willing to fight for their country; but more likely to rate friendship as very important. This evidence suggests a distinctive, less (or differently) embedded, sociality, and lower social conformity, compared to believers. This paper presents early analysis from our Templeton funded Understanding Unbelief project. Reaching for a New Sense of Connection contributes to mapping the diversity of unbelief in Northern and Central Europe by using survey, social media and interview data across six countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Romania). These countries offer diverse (non-) religious backgrounds including post-Communist societies, (eastern Germany, Poland, Romania), environments with strong pressures to religious conformity, (both in the majority culture and minority subcultures); in strong welfare state environments and in less secure contexts; in mixed Christian heritage environments, and with different majority religious heritages (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox). The sample includes environments which have experienced rapid (Netherlands) and gradual (UK) secularization, in cosmopolitan and parochial environments (big cities and small towns), and in environments that have high and low levels of unbelief.

I focus specifically on factors that inhibit or facilitate macro-level secularization and then test the hypotheses using data from nearly all sovereign nation-states in the world.

Secular Worldviews among Young People of Muslim Background,Maruta Herding,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,Anja Frank,The German Youth Institute,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Young Muslims, currently much at the centre of discussion in society, academia and the media, are widely perceived as uniformly and collectively religious. Current survey studies suggest that there are also an increasing number of young European Muslims who refer to themselves as nonbelieving. Within an ethnic minority context in Europe, the worldview of young Muslims may be shaped by their upbringing in a Muslim community and in a widely secular environment. Against this backdrop, an ongoing pilot study aims at tracing the development of individual secular worldviews of young adults of Muslim background in Germany. By means of biography analysis, the study tries to grasp the phenomenon of secular worldviews in a Muslim context. This allows for a close analysis of processes and developments and for studying the features of the individual worldviews in depth.

Do Religious Actors Use Public Reason? The Case of Assisted Dying in Britain,Steven Kettell,University of Warwick,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The socially constructed nature of the 'religious’ and the 'secular’ spheres remains a contested and frequently politicised issue. A key feature of scholarly debate in this area centres around the discursive terms of entry of religion into the public square, and the extent to which Rawlsian public (or secular) reason acts as a prerequisite for, and hence the only valid form of, democratic deliberation. At the present time, however, the character of these debates remains largely confined to a theoretical level, with little empirical research being conducted on the ways in which religious actors themselves actually engage in public discourse. This paper addresses these issues by analysing religious opposition to recent and on-going campaigns for the legalisation of assisted dying in Britain. Based on an analysis of debates centring on the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments, it shows that religious actors have tended towards the use of secular, as opposed to theological, modes of argumentation. This, the paper suggests, denotes a strategic shift on the part of religious actors, shaped by the increasingly diverse nature of the religion and belief landscape in which they operate.",2018,Conference,"Worldviews in World View: Particularizing Secularism, Secularity and Nonreligion",.,.,.,"actor,reason,case,britain,nature,sphere,issue,feature,debate,area,centre,term,entry,religion,square,extent,public,reason,prerequisite,form,deliberation,time,character,debate,level,research,way,actor,discourse,paper,issue,opposition,campaign,legalisation,britain,analysis,debate,westminster,parliament,actor,use,mode,argumentation,paper,shift,actor,nature,religion,belief,landscape"
Trans-Religious Manifestations of the Secular: Revisiting the Concept of Blasphemy in Non-western Contexts,Irmak Yazici,University of Hawaii at Manoa,Hawaii,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper approaches religious controversy as a consequence of flawed and inconclusive processes of secularization in non-western contexts. In order to prove the validity of this approach, a comparative historical analysis of the implementation of secularism in India and Turkey is provided and the Rushdie affair is discussed as the case study that reveals the flawed and inconclusive evolution of secularism in both contexts. Reconceptualization of blasphemy as a socio-political concept rather than a religious one is suggested in consideration of the political reasons behind the affair as opposed to the merely religious/irreligious reasons that had been highlighted by state officials and the media. Implications of the case in both contexts are discussed throughout a critical discursive analysis of the narratives related to the affair.

“Raising secularism”: Secular educational activism in Turkey,Selin Dingiloğlu,Istanbul University,Turkey,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The educational system has recently become one of the most fervent subjects of the secularism versus-Islamism confrontation in Turkey, especially after the educational reforms initiated by the AKP government in line with the publicly announced target for “raising pious generations”. Several public demonstrations against the government’s educational reforms have been accompanied by the formation of parent organizations, NGOs and voluntary scientist and/or educator initiatives (such as online educational networks) for secular education. Besides, in the last decade, there has been an unparalleled increase in the number of private schools, some of which, using the supply of secular education as a marketing tool, have become a secular alternative for many parents. In this research, after summarizing the relevant qualitative and quantitative surveys to portray the big picture, I share the results of my semi-structured interviews with a group of activists (including parents) about their activities for and definitions of a proper secular education, their approaches towards the religion classes and the alternative offered by the private schools and voluntary networks. I examine whether different ideological, religious or class backgrounds of activists matter, and how? Finally, I raise two questions which also have implications for secularism in Turkey in general: Can we talk about “privatization of secularity”, considering the compensation of the lack of public secular education with private or voluntary institutions?

Indirectly measuring unbelief,Will Gervais,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Asking about religious beliefs, or lack thereof, is a sensitive and complex issue. Due to cultural norms, people may be motivated to respond in a socially desirable way. In addition, deliberating about beliefs may yield different responses than intuition-based responses. To develop a better understanding of the relationship between intuition and self-reported belief, we developed a new implicit measure of supernatural belief. Specifically, we adapted the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to measure supernatural belief. In a preregistered online study of 404 American participants, we found that the strength of associations between supernatural entities (e.g., god, devil, heaven) and the concept “real” (as opposed to the concept “imaginary”) predicted self-reported supernatural belief and self-reported religious behavior, and these associations were of comparable magnitude to those found in studies where supernatural belief was measured implicitly using the Implicit Association Test (IAT).

This research will explore a spectrum of beliefs among unbelievers; from the explicit rejection of religion to more agnostic standpoints. The purpose is to address what beliefs, languages and ideas are embraced or negotiated in the absence of religious traditions. In particular, I am interested in the following questions: How do unbelievers discuss the end of life, pain or suffering? What language and symbols are used? What can life stories tell us about agnosticism and unbelief? How do unbelief narratives deal with the idea of “afterlife” and pain? Do accounts of positive and negative forms of unbelief indicate different kinds of attitude toward death, suffering and the afterlife? Life stories will add nuance and context to death, pain and the end of life. Such stories will illuminate the numerous shifts and changes within the life cycle of an individual. Life stories also give participants agency to express which parts of their lives have relevance to the formations of their beliefs and particular worldview, allowing the interviewee to determine which of their experiences is relevant to their understanding of death.

Exploring unbelief in the religious education classroom,Stephen Pett,RE Today Services,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The inclusion of non-religious worldviews has been part of the discourse of religious education (RE) in the UK for some years now. In practice, there is little coherence about how non-religious beliefs or worldviews are handled in the RE classroom: many teachers struggle with this. Humanism is offered by many agreed syllabuses as an example of a non-religious worldview and resources from Humanists UK are increasingly used in classrooms. However, emerging academic research points to different kinds of non-religious worldviews, including but not limited to humanist orientations (e.g., Recognising the Non-religious: Reimagining the Secular, Lee 2015). Research also reveals complexities to non-religious worldviews, such as findings which show that people who do not believe in God and/or identify as non-religious sometimes hold beliefs that do not obviously fit within a materialist worldview: beliefs in supernatural beings, in the soul, in life after death, angels and reincarnation (e.g., Post-religious Britain: The Faith of the Faithless, Spencer/Weldin, Theos 2012; The “No Religion” Population of Britain, Bullivant 2017). It is in this context the Understanding Unbelief programme offers a significant contribution to RE. RE Today has a long history of supporting teachers in the RE classroom, from teachers of 4 year olds to teachers of A level students. Its contribution to the Understanding Unbelief programme is to engage with teachers of 11-14 year olds in the first instance. A future project may look to extend the work to teachers of primary-age pupils. RE Today will develop materials that bring the research findings of the Understanding Unbelief programme to teachers and pupils in the RE classroom. These resources will help pupils to address questions about the nature and diversity of the wide range of beliefs and commitments of so-called unbelievers, including a deeper understanding of atheism and a wider understanding of less discussed outlooks such as agnosticism. The resources will enable pupils to explore what people believe in, not just what they don’t believe in. They will get beyond the stereotypes of New Atheists offered in the media (and some RE lessons), and demonstrate the diversity of experiences and outlooks within the broader ‘unbelieving’ population.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"unbelief,education,classroom,inclusion,worldview,discourse,education,year,practice,coherence,belief,worldview,classroom,teacher,humanism,syllabus,example,worldview,resource,humanist,classroom,research,point,kind,worldview,orientation,lee,research,complexity,worldview,finding,people,god,belief,worldview,belief,being,soul,life,death,angel,reincarnation,britain,faith,spencer,weldin,theos,religion,population,britain,context,unbelief,programme,contribution,today,history,teacher,classroom,teacher,year,old,teacher,level,student,contribution,unbelief,programme,teacher,year,old,instance,project,work,teacher,age,pupil,today,material,research,finding,unbelief,programme,teacher,pupil,classroom,resource,pupil,question,nature,diversity,range,belief,commitment,unbeliever,understanding,atheism,understanding,outlook,agnosticism,resource,pupil,people,stereotype,atheist,medium,lesson,diversity,experience,outlook,population"

Through ethnographic research methods of interviewing, life histories, focus groups and participant-observation, we will investigate whether magical thinking constitutes a core element of human sociality and subjectivity in the everyday context of the mundane and the habitual, even within contexts generally understood as non-religious. Bridging existing research on non-religion with anthropological research on magic, we will explore magical thinking as a reactive dimension of contemporary, secularised societies, focussing on everyday practices through which self-defined unbelievers adopt a stance which can be understood as enchanted, and adopt perspectives of causality which can be understood as magical. More specifically, we will pay emphasis on how people attribute agency and luck to everyday objects, and how magic as a way of thinking and acting in the world manifests in human consciousness under conditions of doubt and uncertainty.

Different secularisms also entail different treatments of nonreligiosity. Nonreligious people, in this respect, face different local opportunity structures in Italy. Despite being a national state, then, nonreligiosity in different local areas has a variety of social meanings, both in connection to the history of religious presence and significance, and in relation to the complexities of local politics.

Social Class and the Stubbornness of Family Myths: How Nonbeliever and Pagan Parents Cope with Intrusions on Parenting by Proselytizing Christian Family Members in the U.S. Bible Belt,Amy I. McClure,Rollins College,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Family scholars have documented how powerful institutions intrude upon marginalized parents. Yet, few have examined the effect that intrusion on parenting takes on a more intimate level. Guided by insights from theories of emotion management and family inequality, I compare how two religiously marginalized groups in the Bible Belt cope with a ubiquitous experience they face as parents—unwelcomed proselytizing by Christian family members. Based on participant-observation and forty in-depth interviews, I document nonbeliever and Pagan parents’ experiences with proselytizing by Christian family members to be common, intrusive, and often perceived as potentially harmful to children. Failing to enforce desired boundaries between children and proselytizers, many parents resort to constructing narratives of equality to describe a condition of inequality. They do so by claiming a “we just don’t talk about religion” arrangement. This narrative, though seemingly equitable, serves as a family myth, obscuring painful truths about power and inequality. Nonbeliever and Pagan parents differ in their reliance on this rhetoric. While nonbeliever parents cling to the family myth as an emotion management device, Pagans more readily acknowledge the “we just don’t talk about religion” strategy as more fiction than fact. I analyze how differences in social class explain nonbelievers’ and Pagans’ differing levels of commitment to this family myth.

"Grounding Non-Theological Morality: The Victorian Secularist Movement, Secular Ethics, and Human Progress",Patrick John Corbeil,Saint Mary’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article examines the formation of British Secularist ethics in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The Secularist movement, initiated by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851, was a primarily artisan working-class social movement that sought to ground social ethics upon a rational, scientific, and non-theological foundation. This article examines how the quest for a science of morals informed Secularist expectations and judgements. In this article, I trace how the idea of a rational science of ethics was integrated into the secularist movement. I begin by briefly situating the Secularist movement within the wider moral and epistemological debates of the mid-Victorian period. I address the implications that atheism had on the development of Secularism, and on its contemporary reputation and respectability. I then examine how Holyoake sought to establish the non-theological grounds of morality and the tensions that arose from debates between Secularists regarding the necessity of atheism to Secularism. Finally, I argue that despite significant fissures within the movement created by the question of the necessity of atheism, Secularism nevertheless evinced a high degree of conceptual unity concerning the nature and grounds of morality.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field",.,"morality,movement,ethic,progress,article,formation,ethic,decade,century,movement,george,jacob,holyoake,class,movement,ethic,foundation,article,quest,science,moral,expectation,judgement,article,idea,science,ethic,movement,movement,debate,period,implication,atheism,development,secularism,reputation,respectability,holyoake,ground,morality,tension,debate,secularist,necessity,atheism,secularism,fissure,movement,question,necessity,atheism,secularism,degree,unity,nature,ground,morality"

In contrast, Orthodox Judaism is widely assumed to depend upon belief in God, with unquestioning belief in the divine (as opposed to human) authorship of the Torah (Hebrew bible) constituting the key theological principle differentiating Orthodoxy from its non-Orthodox counterparts. Furthermore, academic research with increasingly visible strictly Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish populations in Europe and North America, has highlighted the centrality of embodied faith (in Hebrew: emune) in God within Haredi lifeworlds.

The resulting model of deconversion is comprised of three core categories: reason and enquiry, criticism and discontent, and personal development. Despite being closely interlinked, these categories were clearly distinct and represent an intellectual impetus, moral and ethical judgments of religion, and overcoming personal issues, respectively.

Focusing on the differences that occur between quantitative and qualitative approaches to nonbelief – both in terms of defining the research subject-matter and methodologically – it aims to showcase how even slight dissimilarities in definitions and methods can yield widely different results.

"If you don’t go to Church, does religion make a difference?",Conrad Hackett,Pew Research Center,United States,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Many studies have linked regular attendance in a congregation with socially desirable outcomes, such as happiness, health and civic engagement.

In this presentation, I will share results from Pew Research Center analysis of 34 countries with sizeable populations of people who are actively religious (who claim a religious identity and attend services at least monthly), inactively religious (who claim a religious identity and who attend services infrequently) and who claim no religious identity (“nones”). In 27 of the 34 countries studied, the actively religious are a minority of the adult population: Especially in Europe, but also in some countries of Asia and the Pacific, levels of affiliation are declining and regular attendance at religious services is relatively rare.

Cultures of unbelief in the case of Oslo,Erlend Hovdkinn From,University of Oslo,Norway,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In my research, ‘culture’ plays an important part on different levels. Non-religion itself is culturally contingent (Lee 2012 and Quack 2014). In Quack’s methodology ‘non-religion’ is culturally contingent in the sense that the social formation of ‘nones’ happens against and in relation to ‘neighbouring discursive fields’. The most immediately imagined fields are those of dominating religious traditions in a given society. However, I have discovered that it is adequate – if not to say necessary – to explore other fields as well to fully understand contemporary non-religious identities in Oslo. One possible way of approaching this, which I have followed in my research, is the importance of culture in the post-industrial city and how it affects meaning-making in everyday life. In this, ‘culture’ is understood both as it is involved in ethnic compositions of different ‘cultural’ traditions (this is ‘culture’ as in ‘multiculture’), including the religious components, but also how culture plays a role in urban area discourses, which is related to consumerism and a, relatively speaking, new fashion of engaging with urban life, which perhaps is better understood as cultures of postmodernity. The former tells us a lot about how nones perceive their own (non-)religiosity and their perceptions of the religious other, while the latter can teach us a lot about how nones make sense of their everyday life and beyond. This is my methodological proposition: that there is much to learn from exploring discursive fields in which various approaches to ‘culture’ as a concept plays an important part when aiming to understand ‘non-religion’ in all its varieties. In particular, to understand the purportedly ‘indifferent’ stand to faith and worldviews in Scandinavia (e.g. addressed by Zuckerman 2008) we need to investigate how culture itself is changing alongside more ‘obvious’ transformations in the religious landscape. In this paper I will show how this conceptualisation of culture is instrumental for my analysis of the social formation of non-religious identities in Oslo by portraying a sample of different profiles, in which gender, class and ethnicity is decisive.

Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2-3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries.

Unbelief throughout history: Studying atheism in ancient Greece,Ramón Soneira Martínez,University of Erfurt,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It is undeniable that the study of unbelief is receiving much attention in the last decades. The diverse works about the non-religious positions have shown the complexity of the phenomenon of unbelief. The principal aim of this communication is to conceptualize unbelief as a historical notion, principally in Ancient Greece, emphasizing the importance of the religious context in which atheistic positions are developed. The paper is divided into two main parts. The first one focuses on the concept of unbelief, its definition and its methodological potential. Unbelief is a concept particularly used in modern context. However, this paper proposes to apply the term in ancient times. Establishing unbelief as a religious-related field allow us to expand the scope to analyse atheistic positions in “premodern” times. The second part of this analysis is focused on the term “atheism”. In this work, atheism is defined as one of the philosophical positions included in the notion of unbelief. Atheistic positions that consist of denying the nature or the existence of the God or gods are understood as specific philosophical claims of the unbelievers. As so many authors have claimed, atheism cannot be stated as a universal phenomenon. It is a complex position that differs depending on its historical and religious context, especially in how the idea of God or gods has been developed. On the other hand, atheism is not (always) an antireligious position. An unbeliever in the idea of God, an atheist, can be also a believer in other religious elements, for example, soul or a magic force. In that regard, if we connect the complexity of unbelief and the variety of atheism, we can analyse the notion of unbelief in different historical contexts taking into account the peculiarities of each historical “chronotope”, in this case, the religious context of Ancient Greece.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"unbelief,history,atheism,greece,study,unbelief,attention,decade,work,position,complexity,phenomenon,unbelief,aim,communication,unbelief,notion,greece,importance,context,position,paper,part,concept,unbelief,definition,potential,unbelief,concept,context,paper,term,time,unbelief,field,scope,position,time,analysis,term,atheism,work,atheism,position,notion,unbelief,position,nature,existence,god,god,claim,unbeliever,author,atheism,phenomenon,position,context,idea,god,god,hand,atheism,position,unbeliever,idea,god,atheist,believer,element,example,soul,force,regard,complexity,unbelief,variety,atheism,notion,unbelief,context,account,peculiarity,chronotope,case,context,greece"
Minority millennials and disaffiliation from religious communities: What unbelief means for millennials in the 21st century,Aprilfaye Manalang,Norfolk State University,Virginia,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Why do America’s youngest generation disaffiliate from religious communities? How do disaffiliated minority millennials and Generation Z (Gen Z) view religion? How do they navigate their largely religious ethnic communities? Previous research has examined the religiosity of communities of color. However, there is a rising trend of unbelief among Gen Z and minority millennials. This research project investigates the diversity of unbelief among minority millennials and Gen Z; specifically, Filipino-Americans, the second-largest Asian-American group; African-Americans; and Hispanic-Americans. Through 45 in-depth interviews, the following three themes emerge across the interviews: 1) Race and Religion: “Fitting In” and Cultural Hegemony or Cultural Incompatibility and Unbelief; 2) Problematic History, Race, and Religion: The Legacy of Slavery; 3) Cultural Cost of Unbelief: Negotiating Family. Gen Z and minority millennials express skepticism due to past histories related to the church and subsequently question whether their respective race “fits in” with their religion.

Cultural repertoires of nonreligion,Penny Edgell,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a recent summary and review of sociological research on religion, I call for a cultural approach and articulate a research agenda centered on understanding cultural repertoires of religion (religious repertoires). In this paper I argue that a cultural approach to non-religion centered on non-religious repertoires is a useful approach to understanding unbelief.  I explain why this approach avoids the analytical problems associated with a secularization perspective on unbelief, including assumptions of linearity, the idea that unbelief is adequately characterized as an absence or a lack of religion and its attendant associations with community and morality, and the problematic characterization of modernity as entailing a sharp break with the past. Then I outline four ways in which the cultural repertoires approach can focus the attention of researchers in productive ways in growing field of scholarship on unbelief.  First, I discuss how this approach is responsive to the polysemous, contingent, and variable nature of unbelief, which may draw selectively on elements of both religious and secular traditions and combine them in new ways.  Second, I show how this approach directs our attention to unbelief as fostered by an array of organized fields of activity, from explicitly secular to spiritual, religious, and other voluntary organizations.  Third, this approach draws attention to the interconnections between unbelief and practice, including the ritualization and practices of connection and community-building.  Fourth, inherent within this approach is a focus on the importance of understanding variations shaped by national context, regional context, and individuals’ social location within a matrix of identity positions.  In summary, by focusing on nonreligious repertoires, I show that we can make strides in consolidating and expanding our understanding of a classical sociological problem, what C. Wright Mills called the understanding of lives in historical context, by centering the meanings of unbelief within and across social context.

"Understanding unbelief amongst community organisers in Vancouver, Canada",Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly ‘religious’ and ‘nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.,2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"unbelief,community,organiser,vancouver,canada,abby,day,research,nonreligion,belief,question,article,step,way,imaginary,belief,question,researcher,people,time,attention,myth,action,way,imagination,life,people,response,complexity,imagination,belief,distinction,people,psychology,religion,post)protestant,understanding,religion,belief,development,sociology,anthropology,understanding,people,constraint,exploration,imaginary,people,figure,people,life,death,force,character,life"
From secular bodies to secular affects: Understanding cultures of unbelief through affect theory,Donovan Schaefer,University of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper considers the relevance of affect theory for exploring cultures of unbelief. In “Is There a Secular Body?” Charles Hirschkind asks if we can identify “a particular configuration of the human sensorium—of sensibilities, affects, embodied dispositions—specific to secular subjects, and thus constitutive of what we mean by ‘secular society’?” (633) Building on the work of scholars such as Saba Mahmood, Ann Pellegrini, and William Connolly—who have begun the task of connecting affect theory and critical secularism studies—I will argue that affect theory offers a new vocabulary for assessing cultures of unbelief according to their plural affective coordinates. As Charles Taylor has written, one of the central tasks of reconsidering secularism is the move away from “subtraction stories,” in which the extrication of religion leaves a neutral landscape of pure reason untouched by the residue of history. Rather than understanding this residue as vestigial conceptual or metaphysical frameworks, affect theory calls attention to the ways historical change may rewrite a set of beliefs while leaving “the way things feel” untouched, or the ways a shift in what Raymond Williams calls “structures of feeling” can alter the social coordinates of a culture while its metaphysical commitments remain constant. This sets up a rich typology for describing cultures of unbelief according to their affective makeup and building more fruitful comparisons (whether focusing on contrast or continuity) with religious cultures. This is illustrated by a historical case study: the initial design of the Sheldonian Theatre in the late 1660s in Oxford. During the middle ages, the University of Oxford primarily relied on the Church of St. Mary the Virgin for corporate activities, including boisterous spectacles like convocation ceremonies. The Sheldonian was commissioned by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, to create a secular site for such events, avoiding the scandal of a single structure wherein “sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo.” (Newman, “The Architectural Setting,” 161) To describe cultures of unbelief, we must not only examine our intuitions about what secularism “feels like,” but also consider the affective topographies that organize different formations of the secular.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"body,affect,culture,unbelief,affect,theory,paper,relevance,affect,theory,culture,unbelief,body,charles,hirschkind,configuration,sensorium,sensibility,disposition,subject,society,building,work,scholar,saba,mahmood,ann,pellegrini,william,connolly,task,affect,theory,secularism,study,theory,vocabulary,culture,unbelief,coordinate,charles,taylor,task,secularism,subtraction,story,extrication,religion,landscape,reason,residue,history,residue,framework,theory,attention,way,change,set,belief,way,thing,way,shift,raymond,williams,structure,feeling,coordinate,culture,commitment,typology,culture,unbelief,makeup,comparison,contrast,continuity,culture,case,study,design,theatre,1660,oxford,age,university,oxford,church,virgin,activity,spectacle,convocation,ceremony,sheldonian,john,dean,christ,church,site,event,scandal,structure,sacrifice,god,apollo,newman,setting,culture,unbelief,intuition,secularism,topography,formation"
‘Unbelief’ on the ‘Celtic fringe’: A comparative study beyond the city in Scotland and Northern Ireland,Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Scotland and Northern Ireland are constituent regions of the UK that are closely linked by centuries of migration across the North Channel; by problematic entanglements between various forms of Christianity and the state; and by their peripheral position in relation to the locus of UK power. This marginalized position is reflected in the sociological study of religion with many ‘assuming that ‘British society’ is a meaningful and cohesive unity, when, strictly speaking, it has never been that’ (McCrone 2017). Each polity is distinct and multifaceted, yet their historical, social, cultural and religious links, and their shared ‘Celtic fringe’ status, combine to build a strong case for treating them as fruitful sites for the comparative study of ‘unbelief’— ‘used in a wide sense, implying a generalized lack of belief in a God or gods’ (Lee and Bullivant 2016). In this paper, I introduce my ongoing postdoctoral project which conceptualizes ‘unbelief’ as both discursive and political and includes fieldwork in four sites: a village and provincial town in each region. I will first focus upon the methodological hurdles involved in approaching ‘unbelief’ beyond metropolitan centres and argue that contestations surrounding ‘sacred’ values (Knott 2013) can be productive sites for the empirical study of ‘un/belief’. Second, I will address my core research questions considering my ongoing empirical work and analysis: 1) Does ‘unbelief’ look and function in the same way for people from Catholic, Protestant and other religious backgrounds? 2) Does ‘unbelief’ differ between rural areas and metropolitan centres? 3) Do societies characterized by long traditions of Christianity and politicized religious identifications produce particular practices and processes of ‘unbelief’? 4) Where and how do these relate to other social practices and processes of individuals, groups and communities in these two contexts? This paper speaks particularly to theme two of the Cultures of Unbelief conference. It represents an updated version of paper that was accepted for presentation at the BASR-ISASR conference in Belfast, September 2018, which was subsequently withdrawn due to my role as conference organizer and chair of the panel ‘Unbelief Across Borders’.

States and traits: The meaning of uncertainty in nonreligious narratives,Jacqui Frost,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Modernization narratives argue that belief and identity formation in modernity are riddled with uncertainty and instability; certainty is cast as a much desired, but considerably scarce commodity, while states of uncertainty and fluidity are theorized as disorienting and anxiety-inducing. The nonreligious, a sort of bell-weather group for these late-modern secular forms of belief and identity, offer an interesting case for exploring the empirical limits of this ideal-typed “modern” subject. Drawing on an analysis of identity narratives from 50 atheists, agnostics, and other nonreligious Americans, I find that nonreligious organizations and discourses promote both uncertainty and certainty, fostering a spectrum of active identifications and critical uncertainties. I argue that there is more certainty for the nonreligious than our theoretical narratives would predict, much of which is created by the politicization of certainty by nonreligious organizations. I also show that uncertainty and liminality can be intentional nonreligious choices that lead to meaningful worldviews and social engagement. And I reveal how nonreligious individuals often fluctuate between states of certainty and uncertainty regarding their nonreligious beliefs, making it useful to distinguish between certainty and uncertainty as both potentially stable traits as well as transitional or liminal states.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"state,trait,meaning,uncertainty,narrative,modernization,narrative,belief,identity,formation,modernity,uncertainty,instability,certainty,commodity,state,uncertainty,fluidity,anxiety,sort,bell,weather,group,form,belief,identity,case,limit,subject,analysis,identity,narrative,atheist,agnostic,american,organization,discourse,uncertainty,certainty,spectrum,identification,uncertainty,certainty,narrative,politicization,certainty,organization,uncertainty,liminality,choice,worldview,engagement,individual,state,certainty,uncertainty,belief,certainty,uncertainty,trait,state"
Irish Ex-Catholicism and the Morality of Unbelief,Hugh Turpin,Coventry University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While unbelievers are frequently stereotyped as immoral, moral concerns play a defining role in many unbelieving worldviews. Drawing on a nationally representative survey of baptised Catholics and a year-long period of fieldwork, this presentation describes contemporary Irish ex-Catholicism as a particularly heightened example of moralised unbelief. Survey data suggests that for ex-Catholics, the Catholic Church is primarily associated with basic immorality and unpalatable conservativism. Ethnographic fieldwork and interviews suggest that this moral stance is best understood as a reaction to the intertwining forces of religious scandal, the Church’s influence on social institutions, and ‘cultural Catholicism’, a ‘passive’ and ‘complicit’ force perceived to perpetuate the status quo. The moral quest for full liberation from Catholic influence is the central driving component of ex-Catholicism. This ambition is complicated by the existence of a cultural Catholic ‘ethic of harmony’ which prioritises local traditions while privatising personal unbelief. Against this backdrop, cultural Catholics are sometimes viewed as secret unbelievers who ought to be ‘woken’ into disaffiliation so that the project of secularization can be more swiftly achieved.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"catholicism,morality,unbelief,unbeliever,concern,role,worldview,survey,catholic,year,period,fieldwork,presentation,catholicism,example,unbelief,survey,datum,catholic,church,immorality,conservativism,fieldwork,interview,stance,reaction,force,scandal,church,influence,institution,catholicism,force,status,quo,quest,liberation,influence,driving,component,catholicism,ambition,existence,ethic,harmony,tradition,unbelief,backdrop,catholic,unbeliever,disaffiliation,project,secularization"

In this project we develop and explore a new implicit measure of supernatural belief. In Phase One we adapt the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to measure supernatural beliefs implicitly in an American sample. We find that the strength of associations between supernatural entities (e.g., god, devil, heaven) and the concept “real” (as opposed to the concept “imaginary”) predicts self-reported supernatural belief and self-reported religious behaviour.

Material insecurity predicts greater commitment only to moralistic deities: Testing the existential security hypothesis of religious commitment in 14 societies,Benjamin Purzycki,MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology,Germany,M,Adam Baimel,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When, in what ways, and with what intensity do people demonstrate commitment to their gods? The existential security hypothesis predicts that in the absence of more successful secular institutions, people will be attracted to religion when they are materially insecure. Most assessments, however, use group-level data exclusively from state-level societies with world religions. Using individual-level data collected in societies that cover the various scales of human social complexity with diverse religious traditions including animism, shamanism, polytheism, and monotheism, we conducted a systematic cross-cultural test (N = 2027; 14 societies) of the relationship between material security and other relevant demographics (i.e., age, sex, family size, and formal education) and the strength of religious commitment (indexed by two forms of religious commitment - beliefs and practices). In addition to the striking variation we found between demography and religious commitment, we also find support for the existential security hypothesis among moralistic traditions. This support, however, does not extend to other traditions, and in some cases we find the converse, namely, that wealth predicts adherence to local religious traditions.

One of the defining features of this period was the new willingness of different parties, both believers and unbelievers, to engage in dialogue across confessional and ideological lines. Perhaps the most unexpected and radical dialogue to emerge in this historical moment was between religion and socialism, the antagonism between which had been a structuring principle for religious and political life for more than a century, especially in Europe. We can find these new types of encounters between belief and unbelief in developments like the Christian-Marxist dialogues that emerged in both the West and the Communist world; the establishment and work of the Vatican’s Secretariat on Non-Believers, including its 1969 symposium on “The Culture of Unbelief,” which brought together church leaders, theologians, Marxist philosophers and Western sociologists to discuss the contours of modern belief and unbelief; and – most closely connected with my own work on Soviet atheism, recently published in A Sacred Space Is Never Empty: A History of Soviet Atheism (Princeton University Press, 2018) – the transformation in Soviet understandings and approaches to religion and atheism, evident in the emergence of a new forms of “scientific” and even “spiritual” atheism, new sociological studies of religion, and the identification of religious and ideological “indifference” as the defining feature of the modern religious and ideological landscape.

For instance, the report shows how: Unbelief in God doesn’t necessarily entail unbelief in other supernatural phenomena. Atheists and (less so) agnostics exhibit lower levels of supernatural belief than do the wider populations.

The interim findings also shows how on the whole, there are as many similarities as differences between unbelievers and the general population when it come to what is important and what gives meaning in the world, with ‘family’ and ‘freedom’ being the top ranked by both atheists and agnostics, as well as the general population.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"unbelief,discipline,culture,headline,finding,unbelief,core,research,unbelief,discipline,culture,adac,brazil,china,denmark,japan,kingdom,state,finding,difference,theist,atheist,group,belief,messiness,atheism,agnosticism,life,instance,report,unbelief,god,unbelief,phenomenon,atheist,agnostic,level,belief,population,minority,atheist,agnostic,country,naturalist,bullivant,faria,lanman,lee,finding,similarity,difference,unbeliever,population,meaning,world,family,freedom,atheist,agnostic,population"
Modeling Pathways of Unbelief Across Cultural Contexts,F. LeRon Shults,University of Agder,Norway,M,Thomas J. Coleman III,Coventry University,England,M,Marjaana Lindeman,University of Helsinki,Finland,F,Justin Lane,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will address both of the major questions guiding the “Cultures of Unbelief” conference by outlining the conceptual architectures and initial experimental findings of two computational models of unbelief. Social simulation techniques of the sort to be described here enable researchers to test hypotheses about the ways in which micro-level psychological variables and individual behaviors (such as levels of unbelief and affiliation with in-groups that exclude believers) can lead to the emergence of macro-level sociological phenomena at the population level (such as demographic changes related to unbelief and group affiliation). By constructing simulated agents with psychologically realistic cognitive architectures (and individual variables such as class, age, gender and education) who interact within an “artificial society,” and validating those interactions in light of real-world data sets, researchers can run experiments that explore how different cultural contextual conditions (parameters) can alter the pathways through which individual agents alter their religious beliefs and behaviors. And this is exactly what our research teams have done. At last year’s conference in London, we offered an introduction to the relevant models, which were just underway. Our presentation at the NSRN conference was featured in the most recent issue of Der Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/glaube-was-haelt-religionen-zusammen-was-schwaecht-sie-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000161665903. In the currently proposed paper, we would like to present an update on two models that are directly relevant to the conference theme. The first is a systems-dynamics model of the “analytic” pathway to atheism, which includes parameters that allow us to test how contextual factors (such as presence of religion in the environment) impact this pathway. The second is an agent-based model of CRED theory. In the latter, agents have variables such as gender, education, employment, etc., as well as “worldviews” (religious or nonreligious). We will present the architectures and our initial findings, which help to shed light on “the nature of unbelief” and “the ways in which different types of unbelief” shift across cultural contexts.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"pathway,unbelief,context,presentation,question,culture,unbelief,conference,architecture,finding,model,unbelief,simulation,technique,sort,researcher,hypothesis,way,variable,behavior,level,unbelief,affiliation,group,believer,emergence,phenomenon,population,level,change,unbelief,group,affiliation,agent,architecture,variable,class,age,gender,education,society,interaction,light,world,data,set,researcher,experiment,condition,parameter,pathway,agent,belief,behavior,research,team,year,conference,london,introduction,model,presentation,conference,issue,der,spiegel,paper,update,model,conference,theme,system,dynamic,model,pathway,atheism,parameter,factor,presence,religion,environment,pathway,agent,model,cred,theory,agent,variable,gender,education,employment,etc,worldview,architecture,finding,light,nature,unbelief,way,type,unbelief,shift,context"
Examining the Multidimensional Nature of Unbelief: A Psychological Approach,Sean E. Moore,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this talk, I will describe the theoretical basis and results of a program of research that utilizes a psychological understanding of secularism and nonreligion to identify the nature and types of unbelief present in varying cultural contexts. This approach conceptualizes “unbelief” as a collection of interrelated beliefs, attitudes, and value dimensions that are part of a secular meaning system or worldview. Theoretically, this approach is derived from work that has examined the psychology of worldviews and values, cross-cultural psychology, as well as the existential motivations underlying human belief systems. Methodologically, it relies upon the quantitative, self-report methodologies prominently used in psychological assessment and the psychology of religion. By adopting this kind of approach, researchers can conceptualize secularism and nonreligion as a positive belief system that can be both distinct from and overlapping with religious worldviews. In a set of studies, my research team and I used this framework to explore the multidimensional nature of secularism and nonreligion present in samples of Canadian students and a cross-cultural sample of adult respondents from 24 different nations. Survey items were generated via group discussion of the nature of secular worldviews and review of previously published nonreligion typologies. Analysis of the survey responses identified several common core belief dimensions connected to unbelief (e.g., anti-religion/scientism, secular indifference, humanistic values) that were similar across cultural contexts. There were also several key divergences (e.g., cross-national differences and differences across rural versus urban cultural contexts). Importantly, by adopting this belief system framework, we were also able to identify key underlying cultural attitudes, beliefs, and moral orientations connected to particular dimensions of secularism and nonbelief. For example, the presence of individualistic values and moralities based in fairness/justice concerns were correlated with anti-religious beliefs, while experiences with secular upbringing predicted religious indifference. The implications of these findings and the broader significance of a psychological understanding of unbelief for the burgeoning field of secularism studies will be discussed",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"nature,unbelief,approach,talk,basis,result,program,research,understanding,secularism,nonreligion,nature,type,unbelief,context,approach,unbelief,collection,belief,attitude,value,dimension,meaning,system,worldview,approach,work,psychology,worldview,value,psychology,motivation,belief,system,self,report,methodology,assessment,psychology,religion,kind,approach,researcher,secularism,nonreligion,belief,system,worldview,set,study,research,team,framework,nature,secularism,nonreligion,sample,student,sample,adult,respondent,nation,survey,item,group,discussion,nature,worldview,review,nonreligion,typology,analysis,survey,response,core,belief,dimension,unbelief,religion,scientism,indifference,value,context,divergence,difference,difference,context,belief,system,framework,attitude,belief,orientation,dimension,secularism,nonbelief,example,presence,value,morality,fairness,justice,concern,belief,experience,upbringing,indifference,implication,finding,significance,understanding,unbelief,field,secularism,study"
What do unbelievers believe?: A psychological test of form and function,Thomas J. Coleman III,Coventry University,England,M,Jonathan Jong,Coventry University,England,M,Valerie van Mulukom,Coventry University,England,F,Miguel Farias,Coventry University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Compared to the one thing unbelievers reject (i.e. God), very little is known about what unbelievers actually believe in. Moreover, Farias’s (2013) 'replacement hypothesis' suggests that, whatever these beliefs might be, they may replace the psychological functions commonly associated with religious beliefs. Across three studies, our presentation addresses these issues utilizing a mixed-methodological approach. In study one we ask unbelieving individuals directly, 'if you don't believe in God, then what do you believe in?' Through thematic coding, 4 domains of surrogate beliefs were identified (science, humanistic beliefs, believing in one’s self, and moral realism). In study two, we test how these surrogate beliefs may provide meaning in life and protective benefits against death anxiety and perceived stress. In study three, we partially replicate the previous results and test the possibility that surrogate beliefs provide benefits exclusively to unbelievers by comparing a sample of theists and atheists.

I examine the videos and comment sections of 60 US women or gender queer persons in relation to their experiences of, on the one hand, publicly performing atheist identity in the US context, a culture that strongly ties the idea of good citizenship to religiosity. On the other hand, in relation to what it means to speak out as a woman or gender queer person in a minority discourse dominated by men. I thus explore the particular socio-technical affordances shaping these narratives and their reception in relation to femininity, atheism, and the US context, asking how theories of self-performance, counterpublics, and third spaces in digital religion help us understand what is happening in these types of spaces. In examining and extending Warner’s (2005) model of publics, this paper thus considers how vloggers co-effect third spaces of emotive resonance that enable a precarious counterpublicness of performing atheist visibility, and thus aims to highlight emotive and affective aspects of non-religious identity",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"sistah,space,resonance,paper,culture,unbelief,michael,warner,concept,public,counterpublic,video,comment,section,woman,person,relation,experience,hand,identity,context,culture,idea,citizenship,religiosity,hand,relation,woman,gender,person,minority,discourse,man,affordance,narrative,reception,relation,femininity,atheism,context,theory,self,performance,counterpublic,space,religion,type,space,warner,model,public,paper,vlogger,space,resonance,visibility,aspect,identity"
Is Unbelief the New Frontier of Interreligious Dialogue? Religious Literacy in Comparative Context,Justine Ellis,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the past two decades, the concept of religious literacy has gained currency in both scholarly and popular discourse. A trans-Atlantic, Anglophone conversation has emerged as U.S. and U.K. policymakers have called for increased public understanding of religion through educational training programmes within various areas of civil society. In many instances, proponents of religious literacy appear to question unbelievers’ ability to engage with religion, often explicitly citing the idea that the need for religious literacy results from our so-called secular society’s lost ability to interact with religious populations and to identify religious tropes. Against this backdrop, my paper asks what religious literacy could mean within the context of increasing nonreligious populations and a growing awareness of cultures of unbelief. This paper examines the ways in which the U.S. and U.K.’s sociocultural and religious landscapes may inform and impact the representation of unbelief and nonreligion within policy proposals. Taking Christopher Cotter’s (2018) call to bridge the gap between critical religion and the growing area of scholarship on nonreligion, this paper examines the ways in which the constructed categories of religion and nonreligion are treated in comparative contexts of U.S. and U.K. religious literacy proposals. This paper suggests that defining what constitutes religion is not simply an ontological project in this instance. Rather, since religious literacy is by definition rooted in the practical and the practicable, examining what gets included and what gets left off the table has consequences for the presentation of religion and nonreligion in such training programmes. Arguing that the problem and implications of defining religion (and delineating nonreligion) have not been faced fully in policy proposals, this paper contends that religious literacy trainings provide a site from which to question the ethic of inclusion in the growing discussion around how people with and without religious beliefs will collaborate and enter into dialogue",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"unbelief,frontier,dialogue,literacy,context,decade,concept,literacy,currency,discourse,conversation,u.s,u.k,policymaker,understanding,religion,training,programme,area,society,instance,proponent,literacy,unbeliever,ability,religion,idea,need,literacy,result,society,ability,population,trope,backdrop,paper,literacy,context,population,awareness,culture,unbelief,paper,way,u.s,u.k,landscape,representation,unbelief,nonreligion,policy,proposal,christopher,cotter,gap,religion,area,scholarship,nonreligion,paper,way,category,religion,nonreligion,context,u.s,u.k,literacy,proposal,paper,religion,project,instance,literacy,definition,table,consequence,presentation,religion,nonreligion,training,programme,problem,implication,religion,nonreligion,policy,proposal,paper,literacy,training,site,ethic,inclusion,discussion,people,belief,dialogue"
Reimagining the Imaginaries: Towards a Biocultural Theory of Nonreligion,Mari Ovsepyan,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A number of scholars of nonreligion and secularity have argued in recent years for the need to get beyond the neat binaries and the negative identities signaled by atheism and agnosticism (e.g., Taves, Asprem & Ihm, 2018). Charles Taylor in his seminal work A Secular Age (2007) makes a famous case against the ‘subtraction stories’ expressed in the popular narrative as a mere reduction of religious belief. Taylor’s interpretation is deeply psychological and gives an account of the radical transformation of the social imaginaries that shape the way we conceptualize the world we inhabit. However, there is little attention given to the non-cognitive aspects of the social imaginaries in recent scholarship. Kathleen Lennon argues that imaginaries should be defined as the ‘bearers of affective significance, the means by which we not only think but feel our way around that world’ (Lennon, 2004: 111). Conceptualizing imaginaries as a way of collective production of sense offers a helpful way of engaging with the question of how differently historied bodies come to experience and engage with the world in different ways, and leads to the possibility of thinking about the role of imaginaries in constituting different minds and different bodies with different capacities. In this paper I will argue that the language of social imaginaries is helpful for building a bridge between the cognitive and affective elements of nonreligion. I will engage with the recent work of cognitive anthropologists Tanya Luhrmann and Even Danziger on metacognitive diversity and the ‘local theories of mind’ and the role they play in religious experience to argue that a more polyvalent way of approaching social imaginaries offers a helpful contribution to the biocultural theory of both religion and non-religion.",2019,Conference,Cultures of Unbelief,.,.,.,"imaginary,theory,nonreligion,number,scholar,nonreligion,secularity,year,need,binary,identity,atheism,agnosticism,tave,asprem,ihm,charles,taylor,work,age,case,subtraction,story,narrative,reduction,belief,taylor,interpretation,account,transformation,imaginary,way,world,attention,aspect,imaginary,scholarship,kathleen,lennon,imaginary,bearer,significance,mean,way,world,lennon,imaginary,way,production,sense,way,question,body,world,way,possibility,role,imaginary,mind,body,capacity,paper,language,imaginary,bridge,element,nonreligion,work,anthropologist,tanya,luhrmann,danziger,diversity,theory,mind,role,experience,way,imaginary,contribution,theory,religion,religion"
Understanding unbelief in the mindfulness subculture,Masoumeh Sara Rahmani,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Mindfulness meditation has entered the British and American mainstream culture as a secular, scientific technique that supports both physical and mental health. Consequential to its secular framing, mindfulness has been particularly appealing to non-religious peoples who seek out this practice as means to improve their well-being. Yet, for many people, Mindfulness can become more than a mere technique; it can become a major source of meaning in their lives, informing their values, reshaping their self-concept, and even altering their conceptions of the world and their relations with transcendent realities. This paper draws on in-depth and longitudinal interviews with meditators in the UK and the US to explore the range of non-believer identities and outlooks that are constituted in the Mindfulness subculture. In particular, it traces the influence of the practice on the meditators’ worldviews, asking: To what extent, and in which direction, does the practice steer the trajectory of their lives?

What “implicit belief” can tell us about the nature and ubiquity of not believing,Jamin Halberstadt,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,Jesse Bering,University of Otago,New Zealand,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although motivational theories in the field emphasize the importance of defending religious beliefs, our previous research suggests that unbelief, for some people, is an equally coherent and functional worldview, which they will be highly motivated to defend. To study such defense, we have developed a semi-structured interview procedure to probe for seemingly inexplicable events (e.g., premonitory dreams, sightings of apparitions, out-of- body experiences). In a pilot study involving over 200 American participants (mostly unbelievers of several varieties that we did not distinguish), approximately 80% endorsed the claim that “there are phenomena that science cannot, and will never be able to explain.” Even more interesting, among participants who believed science can explain everything, one third stated that they personally had experienced events (often involving purported ghosts or paranormal phenomena) that challenged that belief. In an online follow-up, we questioned more than 700 “extinctivists” (people who believe that the “soul” ceases when the physical body dies) to investigate the frequency with which they experience challenging events, the types of challenging experiences that they reported, and finally how they have reconciled them with their existing views concerning the afterlife. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative coding, we have established a framework for classifying both participants’ experiences, and their strategies for defending their worldviews. Overall 33% (n=238) of extinctivists reported having had experiences that challenged their afterlife beliefs. The most frequently reported type of experience involved encounters with ghosts or spirits. other represented categories included: near death experiences, out of body experiences, unexplainable dreams, religious experiences, precognitions, and hallucinations.

My interviews support their claim; they make sense of their contradictions in a similar narrative. Although this might signal absence of strong belief in religion or, even culture, my research also highlights a variety of more committed beliefs in relationships with people around them, such as family, children, neighbours and humanity in general. For example, whilst some immediately reject existence of angels, ghosts or spirits of gods, they hesitate to do so with spirits of ancestors because such rejection seems disrespectful even if they admit that they only believe in what they can actually see.

Based on this interdisciplinary review, it is noted that, if relying on the survey model in either qualitative or quantitative research, the studies are likely to sustain the cultural categories of “religion” and “nonreligion” that, paradoxically, are implicitly defined by the survey model, and remain at the level of reputation management.

The Office of the Clerk is currently revising the list of sample prayers to include a greater diversity of beliefs. To accomplish this task, bureaucrats face a number of practical and constitutional challenges. This article explores these challenges.

The scientific meaning for 'secular’ has an origin and independent role apart from both religion and secularization. Fields in the social sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences have been using the concepts of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ for almost two centuries. The field of economics was the first among the social sciences, while epidemiology was the first in the life sciences. Both disciplines adapted the use of 'secular trend’ and 'secular variation’ from the earth sciences, which borrowed the idea of 'secular’ from astronomy. Early astronomical texts first used 'secular’ to describe 'secular inequalities’ and 'secular variations’ in long-term patterns to celestial motions. Astronomers had found saeculum to be a convenient Latin word from ancient Rome to refer to a century’s duration.

His short sentence draws some of its meaning from its immediate context (his essay against occultism), but also from its broader context, the Hegelian notion of the World Spirit.

The latter camp argues that atheism does not include a set of socio-political markers that sets it off from other movements; it is mainly a science- and reason-based philosophy challenging belief in the supernatural that can be adapted to a wide range of political orientations. We find this view increasingly reflected among both atheist and secular humanist leaders and publications, especially in the “new atheist” movement, which has drawn high proportions of atheists interested in science. In this paper, we will examine the political discourse and views of atheist leaders and opinion-makers and those of members of atheist-secular humanist organizations during and after the 2016 elections.

"Going Godless: Black Feminism, Humanism, and Anti-Racism",Sikivu Hutchinson,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a 2012 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation Survey, 87% of African American women are religious, making African American women among the most religious demographic groups in the U.S. Although Black women have long been stereotyped as the “backbone” of the Black Church, some Black women non-theists and humanists are bucking these traditions to challenge organized religion. Historically, Black women have relied on churches and faith-based institutions as vehicles for political organizing, cultural identity, and community solidarity. It is for this reason, as well as the slave-era stigma associated with Black female sexuality, that being a Black female humanist and atheist is even more taboo than being a Black male atheist. Dehumanized as either hyper-sexual Jezebels or asexual Aunt Jemimas, Black women have been constructed as less moral, less human, less chaste, and less civilized than respectable white Christian women. “Going Godless” will examine this history vis-à-vis the emergence of Black feminist humanist perspectives in the American secular humanist and atheist movements. For example, how have Black women humanists and atheists drawn on the feminist/womanist legacy of writers and thinkers like Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Nella Larsen?

Imaginary Friends and Made-Up Stories: How to Explore (Non)Religious Imaginaries Without Asking Belief-Centred Questions,Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly 'religious’ and 'nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.,2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.,"friend,story,imaginary,belief,question,abby,day,research,nonreligion,belief,question,article,step,way,imaginary,belief,question,researcher,people,time,attention,myth,action,way,imagination,life,people,response,complexity,imagination,belief,distinction,people,psychology,religion,post)protestant,understanding,religion,belief,development,sociology,anthropology,understanding,people,constraint,exploration,imaginary,people,figure,people,life,death,force,character,life"

Despite the worldwide resurgence of supernaturalist religion, some subcultures reliably produce people who deny the existence of supernatural entities. This social phenomenon has evoked competing explanations, many of which enjoy empirical support. We synthesize six of the most influential social-science explanations, demonstrating that they provide complementary perspectives on a complex causal architecture. We incorporate this theoretical synthesis into a computer simulation, identifying conditions under which the predominant attitude toward supernaturalism in a population shifts from acceptance to rejection (and vice versa). The model suggests that the conditions for producing widespread rejection of supernatural worldviews are highly specific and difficult to produce and sustain. When those conditions combine, which is historically rare, a stable social equilibrium emerges within which post-supernaturalist worldviews are widespread; however, this equilibrium is easier to disrupt than equilibria whose cohesion is stabilized by supernatural religion due to persistent cognitive tendencies toward supernaturalism in evolved human minds.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.,.,"culture,abandonment,belief,ritual,context,culture,set,condition,scale,resurgence,supernaturalist,religion,subculture,people,existence,entity,phenomenon,explanation,support,science,explanation,perspective,architecture,synthesis,computer,simulation,condition,attitude,supernaturalism,population,shift,acceptance,rejection,model,condition,rejection,worldview,condition,equilibrium,worldview,equilibrium,equilibrium,cohesion,religion,tendency,supernaturalism,mind"

The present study collected data from a sample of survivors of a natural disaster event (i.e., a tornado) to test the relationship between (non)religiosity/(non)spirituality, coping, psychological distress, and posttraumatic growth. Statistical models suggested that problem-focused coping facilitated posttraumatic growth and lower levels of psychological distress among people with lower levels of institutional religiousness and/or individual spirituality (consistent with predictions), but not among people at high levels of religiousness/spirituality (contrary to predictions). Participants with moderate levels of institutional religiousness reported more dysfunctional coping and higher levels of psychological distress, as predicted. Emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer depressive symptoms following trauma among participants with low levels of institutional religiousness. These data suggest a complex relationship between trauma, posttraumatic growth, distress, and coping among varying levels of (non)religiousness/(non)spirituality.

Popularized in the Middle Ages, it was used religiously to represent a sense of remorse for one’s sins or feelings of confidence, loyalty, love, and worship.[1] While genuflection was never restricted to a religious context, often being used symbolically in political rituals, scholars agree that its universal connotation is one of respect, deference, humility, vulnerability,[2] and belittling of one’s self.[3] Members of different faiths today still kneel as part of several religious and spiritual rituals, such as collective and individual prayer in the Christian and Muslim traditions. More recently, genuflection has been used with a secular, or nonreligious, twist after the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick chose to take a knee during the US national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. While kneeling is often constructed as a religious gesture – including in the world of football where it is frequently used by athletes partaking in individual and collective prayer rituals – the participants in this study never referred to genuflection in the context of the protests as a religious act, but rather as a nonreligious act of contestation. Overall, my results show that despite the backlash received by NFL protesters from critics who believe their kneeling is a sign of disrespect to the US national anthem, the flag, and the military, insiders from the world of professional football tend to see the kneeling as 1) a show of unity and solidarity; 2) as a way to mourn for the lives lost due to acts of police brutality against people of color; and 3) as a tool to bring awareness to the issue of racism in the United States.","knee,nfl,movement,gesture,reverence,protest,blog,mathilde,vanasse,pelletier,issue,appropriation,gesture,protester,football,league,nfl,history,gesture,genuflection,meaning,context,age,sense,remorse,sin,feeling,confidence,loyalty,love,worship.[1,genuflection,context,ritual,scholar,connotation,respect,deference,humility,belittling,self.[3,member,faith,today,ritual,prayer,tradition,genuflection,twist,nfl,san,francisco,49er,quarterback,colin,kaepernick,knee,anthem,racism,police,brutality,gesture,world,football,athlete,prayer,ritual,participant,study,genuflection,context,protest,act,act,contestation,result,backlash,nfl,protester,critic,kneeling,sign,disrespect,anthem,flag,military,insider,world,football,kneeling,unity,solidarity,way,life,act,police,brutality,people,color,tool,awareness,issue,racism,state"

We find that religious individuals are more likely to believe humans are stewards of nature while nonreligious individuals are more likely to see humans as part of nature or that nature is in control. We find very few differences between the religious and nonreligious when examining what they obtain from the time they spend in nature walking, hiking, or trekking.

The data consists of interviews with 42 people living in Canada and Finland. I analyse food related talk as an ethical narrative that articulates moral subject positions.

Further, in order to trouble these anthropocentric notions, the study detects a third role: the garburator role illuminates the corporeality of humans in food waste relations; the specific human bodies that bear responsibility in food waste relations; and the embodied limits of humans in these relations.

It specifically uses relational theories of nonreligion to demonstrate how the tribunal constructs ethical veganism to be distinct from religion, while also positioning it into various relationships with religion. This relational approach offers insights into how the law draws on religion to imagine and define beliefs that are not explicitly or essentially religious.

When compared to a catch-all category of “nones,” the religious are often found to be happier, healthier, and to have a greater sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. Recent research by nonreligion scholars that accounts for the diversity of the nonreligious has upended these assumptions, showing that some subgroups of nonreligious people, particularly atheists, are just as happy and healthy as religious people. In this paper, we contribute to these discussions by analyzing how the nonreligious life course matters for health and wellbeing. Drawing on new survey data that includes measures of respondents’ comfort with their nonreligion and how recently they became nonreligious, we show that much of the variation in health and happiness among the nonreligious is moderated by how long a respondent has been nonreligious.

The objective of this presentation is to detail the non-religious responses given by ED workers to requests made by vulnerable patients in relation to the respect of their religious obligations (e.g. compliance with prohibitions on religious holidays, religious diets or on-site rituals).

In many societies, importance is placed on rituals at birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death. In the United States, these events often have a religious tint. Secular people also experience life-cycle transitions and must make choices in how they mark these events. Drawing on data from the Secular Communities Survey (SCS), we explore how secular people adapt what may be viewed as religious ritual to accommodate their secular beliefs and values. In particular, death rituals are instances in which the transition from living to dead is acknowledged. I argue that this ontological moment is a window into the nexus of belief, practice, and sociality that secular people must reconcile.

The first is a rejection of certain kinds of authority, namely those based upon theist worldviews such as the divine right of kings. The second is an oppositional, contrarian ethos, in part because of the fact that atheists have often, though not always, been a persecuted minority group.

It shows that policy responses follow distinctive types of logic between the various levels of governance, and, furthermore, that material solutions matter as well. In a departure from this major finding, author Rosemarie van den Breemer argues for a ‘two-pronged strategy’ in the study of state responses to religion and nonreligion, one that oscillates between theory development and everyday empirical analysis. On the conceptual level, her account deals with the discussion of reified state-church models in the ‘religious governance’ literature and with the concept of secularism in the research agenda of ‘the multiple secularisms and secularities.’ On the empirical level, she carefully maps out the previously uncharted institutional domain of cemeteries.

Religious Decline since the Church-State Separation in Sweden,Isabella Kasselstrand,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In 2000, the Church of Sweden was disestablished as a State church. As all citizens were historically members regardless of religious convictions, the Church has predominantly symbolized a cultural heritage in a secularizing society. However, since the church-state tie was severed, there has been a sharp decline in membership, from 83% of the population in 2000 to 56% in 2019. Given that Swedes now make more active choices about their religious affiliation, a reasonable assumption is that those who choose to remain are more pious than the church body was before the disestablishment. Yet, contrary to this hypothesis, findings from ISSP data (1998-2018) suggest that not only the unaffiliated, but also the remaining Church of Sweden adherents, have in fact continued to become less likely to believe in God or a higher power, showing clear trends toward ongoing secularization both within the Church and in the population as a whole.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"decline,church,state,separation,sweden,church,sweden,state,church,citizen,member,conviction,church,heritage,society,church,state,tie,decline,membership,population,swede,choice,affiliation,assumption,church,body,hypothesis,finding,datum,church,sweden,adherent,fact,god,power,trend,secularization,church,population"
In Satan We Trust: The Satanic Temple’s Activism,Mathieu Colin,University of Montreal,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper aims to demonstrate how the Satanic Temple represents a new form of religious expression. They claim to be a Satanist group that belongs to the rationalist branch of contemporary Satanism (Petersen 2009); they are political activists who advocate secularism and separation of church-state; and they consider the Satanic Temple as a religious group that promotes an “atheistic religion” (Greaves 2013). Their purpose is to propose a religious alternative that fights for pluralism and religious freedom with a secularist approach, by challenging the power of organized religions in the public sphere. The provocative and religious approach of the Temple intends to challenge and to balance the power of Christianity in the US. Therefore, this paper will argue that the Satanic Temple is a unique example of the recent politicization of the non-religious minority (Cimino and Smith 2014), in order to counterbalance the presence of religion in the public sphere and its influence on public policies. It is also an original way to explore the link between secularism and power through the negotiation of tensions between the Temple and other religious groups. Moreover, it is an opportunity to study religion as a political expression, since the Satanic Temple states that their political activism is their religion. This paper will examine some of their actions as well as their views on religious freedom and pluralism that result from them.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"satan,temple,activism,paper,temple,form,expression,satanist,group,branch,satanism,petersen,activist,secularism,separation,church,state,temple,group,religion,greave,purpose,alternative,pluralism,freedom,approach,power,religion,sphere,approach,temple,power,christianity,paper,temple,example,politicization,minority,cimino,smith,order,presence,religion,sphere,influence,policy,way,link,secularism,power,negotiation,tension,temple,group,opportunity,religion,expression,temple,activism,religion,paper,action,view,freedom,pluralism"

Seeking to qualify this transnationalism in relation to 2019’s Bill 21, we ask: which arguments from the francophone transnational sphere resonated most? Which actors (e.g., intellectuals, thinkers and activists) facilitated this circulation?

Despite identifying outside organized religion, nones are not uniformly non-religious.

It draws on data from three waves of the ISSP religion module in four countries - France, Germany, Sweden and the UK. Multivariable regressions demonstrate that disaffiliates are consistently more religious than cradle nones, due to a religious residual from childhood, which helps explain the variance in religiosity among nones. Furthermore, religiosity declines among both groups over time, particularly in Germany, with its higher proportion of second generation lifelong nones. Religiosity among nones is temporary, weakening with each passing generation due to secularization processes, which is only slightly mitigated by countervailing individualization trends.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"residual,variation,religiosity,number,none,europe,year,religion,none,order,none,paper,impact,affiliation,religiosity,disaffiliate,none,datum,wave,issp,religion,module,country,france,germany,sweden,regression,disaffiliate,cradle,none,residual,childhood,variance,religiosity,none,religiosity,group,time,germany,proportion,generation,none,religiosity,none,generation,secularization,process,trend"

Rethinking Nonreligion in Canadian Law: Looking Beyond Atheism,Cory Steele,University of Ottawa,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Since the 1960s, Canada, like many other Western countries, has experienced a rapid growth in the number of people who identify as having “no religion.” This increase in the nonreligious has prompted various social institutions to reconsider a number of policies to ensure this growing population is afforded full and equal participation in society. The law has been called on by the nonreligious to decide upon the constitutionality of various social practices promoted by the State, including the use of prayer to open municipal town hall meetings, and legislation that has often prohibited access to physician-assisted dying, same-sex marriage, and abortion. Interestingly, however, most cases brought before courts by the nonreligious are done so by atheists. Thus, legal institutions have largely only addressed one type of nonreligion. Given this limited engagement, what, then, are the implications of this for nonreligion? This paper argues that the law imagines most nonreligious individuals as “atheists” and conceptualizes atheism, and therefore nonreligion more generally, as simply lacking a belief in God.

Phelps Bondaroff,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Daily sittings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia begin with a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) delivering a prayer or reflection of their own devising, or reading one from a list provided by Legislative staff. This list of sample prayers was recently revised by the Office of the Clerk to include prayers from a number of religious traditions. To update this list, the Office of the Clerk needed to identify religious and belief groups in BC, select a reasonable number of those groups to include on the list, and identify prayers and reflections that are representative of those traditions. Each of these steps raises practical questions with respect to how bureaucrats can make these decisions, and to more fundamental questions regarding the appropriateness of the decisions made. We conclude that the practice of offering sample prayers be avoided, or that legislative prayer be abolished.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"arbiter,faith,assembly,columbia,entanglement,dogma,prayer,sitting,assembly,columbia,member,assembly,mla,prayer,reflection,devising,list,staff,list,sample,prayer,office,clerk,prayer,number,tradition,list,office,clerk,belief,group,number,group,list,prayer,reflection,tradition,step,question,respect,bureaucrat,decision,question,appropriateness,decision,practice,sample,prayer,prayer"

It examines prayers delivered in the Legislature from October 2, 2003, to August 14, 2020. The religiosity, content, structure, and length of prayers, along with who is delivering them, is analyzed and changes are tracked over time and between parties. In late 2019, the BC Legislature amended its practices and changed the name of this element of routine business from ‘prayers’ to ‘prayers and reflections,’ and updated and expanded the list of sample prayers from which members can read. We examine how participation in prayer and the religiosity, content, structure, and length of prayers delivered in the Legislature have varied since these changes were made.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"change,prayer,analysis,prayer,assembly,columbia,paper,practice,sitting,legislature,columbia,prayer,prayer,legislature,october,august,religiosity,content,structure,length,prayer,change,time,party,legislature,practice,element,business,prayer,prayer,reflection,list,sample,prayer,member,participation,prayer,religiosity,content,structure,length,prayer,legislature,change"
Re-Disenchanting Weber: Looking again at “Science as a Vocation”,Donovan Schaefer,University of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Charles Taylor writes that “[e]veryone can agree that one of the big differences between us and our ancestors of 500 years ago is that they lived in an ‘enchanted’ world and we do not.” (“Western Secularity,” 38) But what disenchantment means is a moving target. Critics such as George Levine, Jane Bennett, and Jason Josephson-Storm have argued that the disenchantment narrative is flawed—that even in modern secularity, “we have never been disenchanted.” This paper takes a different tack. Going back to Max Weber’s “Science as a Vocation,” it argues that rather than disenchantment being a “myth,” disenchantment is not what we think it is. For Weber in this essay, disenchantment is not so much the eradication of feeling as it is a rearrangement of feeling and thinking into new affective forms. This calls on us to rethink how disenchantment fits into theories of secularization.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"weber,science,vocation,charles,taylor,e]veryone,difference,ancestor,year,world,secularity,disenchantment,target,critic,george,levine,jane,bennett,jason,josephson,storm,disenchantment,narrative,secularity,paper,tack,max,weber,science,vocation,disenchantment,myth,disenchantment,weber,essay,disenchantment,eradication,feeling,rearrangement,feeling,form,disenchantment,theory,secularization"
“How Could Rodney Stark Have Been So Wrong?”,Phil Zuckerman,Pitzer College,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Rodney Stark has been one of the leading sociologists of religion in the USA for decades. Chief among his contributions has been a scathing attack on secularization theory. Stark insists that secularization has not occurred, cannot occur, and that the world is actually more religious than ever. However, the data is not on his side. Secularization has indeed occurred, dramatically so. How could Stark have been so wrong? In this paper, I will show how Stark got secularization wrong, and posit some guesses as to why he was so mistaken.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"rodney,sociologist,religion,usa,decade,chief,contribution,attack,secularization,theory,secularization,world,datum,secularization,paper,secularization,guess"
From the Census to the Academic Literature: Mapping the Framing of Nonreligion in Brazil,Henrique Fernandes Antunes,Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning,Brazil,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The results of the last censuses have sparked a growing interest in the increase of people who declare themselves 'nonreligious' in Brazil, mobilizing various social segments, such as the media, academia, religious institutions, non-governmental organizations, among others, in a climate of uneasiness that seeks to understand the impacts of such growth to Brazilian society. Based on this uneasiness, this presentation intends to take a step back, analyzing the ways in which the category 'nonreligion' was developed as a census terminology, being incorporated later into the academic debate, constituting a new analytical object and, at the same time, a new social segment. We intend to demonstrate that the advance of 'nonreligion' in Brazil is understood by the academic literature as part of the social dynamics that have altered the configurations of the Brazilian religious field. In this movement, nonreligion is not apprehended as an alternative to religion or its opposite, but as one of the multiple options within the Brazilian religious field.",2021,Conference,Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network,.,.,.,"census,literature,framing,nonreligion,brazil,result,census,interest,increase,people,brazil,segment,medium,academia,institution,organization,climate,uneasiness,impact,growth,society,uneasiness,presentation,step,way,category,nonreligion,census,terminology,debate,object,time,segment,advance,nonreligion,brazil,literature,dynamic,configuration,field,movement,nonreligion,alternative,religion,opposite,option,field"
"Images of Place, Secularity and Gentrification: On Urban Religious Belonging in an Inner City Neighbourhood in Oslo",Erik Thorstensen,Work Research Institute,Norway,M,Aina Landsverk Hagen,Work Research Institute,Norway,F,Ingar Brattbakk,Work Research Institute,Norway,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Through extensive fieldwork conducted in an inner city neighbourhood in Oslo, Norway, the authors found that a variation of actors and settings evoked different religious and secular images of place. In what ways is the urban experience shaping or challenging the religious sense of spatial belonging, and why is a secular discourse dominating the scene? In order to obtain such images and sense of place in the context of a recently established area based initiative, we interviewed representatives for the religious communities localized in the neighbourhoods of Tøyen and Grønland. Here we encountered no religiously infused language despite a sizeable spatial religious presence. In the sciences of religion, the view of a separation between the secular and the religious as a social fact and a social norm in modern societies dominates. We argue that there is a privatization of religion (Casanova 1994) within the larger discourse of urban renewal and gentrification. Simultaneously we find the reverse of Taylor’s (2007) proposal of the emptying of religion in social space: namely a filling up of religion in social spaces, that we label ‘urban religious belonging’. This article provides further empirically based knowledge into the connection of religion, secularism and the urban sphere, the difference between belief and representations or discourses, as well as a methodological approach for studying these connections and fractures.",2021,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,10,.,.,"image,place,secularity,gentrification,belonging,city,neighbourhood,oslo,fieldwork,city,neighbourhood,oslo,norway,author,variation,actor,setting,image,place,way,experience,sense,belonging,discourse,scene,order,image,sense,place,context,area,initiative,representative,community,neighbourhood,tøyen,grønland,language,presence,science,religion,view,separation,fact,norm,society,privatization,religion,casanova,discourse,renewal,gentrification,reverse,taylor,proposal,emptying,religion,space,filling,religion,space,belonging,article,knowledge,connection,religion,secularism,sphere,difference,belief,representation,discourse,approach,connection,fracture"
Unravelling the Indian Conception of Secularism: Tremors of the Pandemic and Beyond,Malcolm Katrak,O. P. Jindal Global University,India,M,Shardool Kulkarni,Chambers of Dr. Abhinav Chandrachud,India,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The State's engagement with religion has formed one of the recurring themes of conflict in India's democratic experiment. The Indian model of secularism, which evolved in an attempt to resolve this conflict, has distinguished itself from separation-model secularism. This paper seeks to analyse the impact of the measures undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian understanding of secularism. To this end, it provides an overview of the nature and evolution of Indian secularism. Thereafter, it encapsulates the steps taken by the State to meet the exigencies of the present contagion and attempts to gauge the impact of the said steps on the jurisprudence on religious freedoms. It then seeks to contextualise this impact by using it to inform the Indian conception of secularism and, thereby, promote a richer, more holistic understanding of how a deeply divided society has functioned as a secular State for seven decades.",2021,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,10,.,.
