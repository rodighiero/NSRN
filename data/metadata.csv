Believing in belonging': Researching belief without asking religious questions,Abby Day,University of Sussex,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A unique research method was designed to answer the question: 'What do people believe in nowadays and how do we find out?' This approach was the first in the sociology of Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives religion to research belief by asking non-religious questions of apparently non-religious people. My qualitative method, detailed here, produced data that led me to conclude that statements of religious affiliation are often expressions of 'believing in belonging', where people associate with religion to reinforce ethnic, familial, or other social identities.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Members of Atheist/Freethought/Secularist organizations in Germany and the United States,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I would like to contribute a paper documenting my current research on organized atheism in Germany and the United States. With my study, I set out to investigate the motives, experiences, and biographies of those who have become more or less active members of primarily politically oriented (rather than philosophical, academic, or congregational) atheist / freethought / secularist organizations. While focusing only on members of this particular type of organization, my aim has been to vary the members' characteristics with regard to their age, gender, duration of membership, degree of activism, and socio-religious background as much as possible. With respect to the latter aspect, I have conducted interviews with members of German IBKA (International League of Non-Religious and Atheists) and BfG (Bavarian Freethought Association) in generally atheistic Berlin, religiously mixed North Rhine Westphalia, and traditionally Catholic Bavaria, as well as with members of local chapters and affiliates of the U.S. organizations American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International in California, Minnesota, and Georgia. All in all, from the summer of 2007 until the summer of 2009, I have conducted more than sixty interviews At Oxford, I would like to briefly present the sampling method employed (both with respect to sampling organizations as well as sampling interviewees), the interviewing technique used, as well as some preliminary findings on who the members of this type of organizations are.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.

A secular mind,Jonathan A. Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Cognitive anthropologists argue that we can better answer enduring anthropological questions by utilizing the growing insights of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This belief is not wholly unjustified, as cognitive anthropologists have had some success in addressing the long-standing question of why religious beliefs and practices are so widespread in human populations, mostly in reference to universal cognitive biases. This success, however, raises another enduring anthropological question, that of how to best account for ―secularization.‖ If religious beliefs are so well supported by universal cognitive biases, whence secularization and atheism? In this presentation, I will argue that a cognitive approach can help answer one important element of the secularization debate, the question of whether or not particular socio-economic environments cause decreased levels of religious belief and commitment. I will present both qualitative and quantitative data from my fieldwork and survey research among non-theists in Western countries suggesting that particular socio-economic environments do indeed lower levels of religious belief and that this effect occurs through the impact of these environments on our cognitive mechanisms devoted to reasoning about social groups and about what representations to accept from others.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Theoretical and methodological resources for breaking open the secular and exploring the boundary between religion and non-religion,Kim Knott,University of Leeds,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The secular condition, secularism and the associated non-religious ideological categories of agnosticism and atheism have particular significance in contemporary Europe. Given that these concepts and their associated fields of belief, practice and organization represent a counter-field of interest for scholars of religion, as well as an increasingly important arena in the politics of religion, we ignore them at our peril. I shall consider the conceptual and categorical relationship between the religious and the secular, the boundary which separates them, and the resources that are available in the study of religion for examining this relationship. In particular, I shall refer to three approaches: historical/conceptual, spatial/discursive, and cognitive/cultural. These are all tools for understanding more about how we see imagine, define, classify and represent religion and its other (whether we call that non-religion or the secular), tools that, once employed, might challenge the categories we use and the anxieties they induce. Furthermore, I will examine what happens around the boundary between the religious and the secular and make a case for a reconstitution of the object of the discipline of religious studies to include non-religion as well as religion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Supernatural agency detection in random visual noise,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the cognitive science of religion it has been suggested that belief in supernatural agents is ubiquitous because of its capacity to fit the human cognitive system. Specifically, Barrett (2004) has suggested that a hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD), alongside other cognitive tools such as Theory of Mind, mediates this belief. Due to the hypersensitivity of the agency detection device, it is prone to find agents in the environment, even when none are present. Why some individuals do not believe in supernatural agency despite presumably still having a HADD has, however, previously gone untested. The task set was to detect (1) when the stimulus was a degraded image, and (2) what the image was (free response). Data from these tasks provide information on controlled and automatic dispositional factors at work during agency detection. Preliminary results suggest that there is a significant difference in the types of agency and non-agency detected within the random stimuli. This was across the participant groups, however, and there was no significant difference between the two belief-groups regarding the frequency with which agency was detected. Significant differences between the two participant groups were found, however, when analysing levels of psychoticism, boundaries and empathy, highlighting potential confounding variables that may interfere with the study of agency detection in religious and non-religious participants.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Atheism in post-socialist conditions: The examples of Slovenia and Croatia,Marjan Smrke,University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the majority of countries in Western Europe have become more secular in recent times, most post-socialist countries have been undergoing a process of desecularization. The disintegration of the socialist regime in Yugoslavia, which functioned as a sort of secular civil religion, took place in a period of escalating intranational tensions, conflicts, and ethno-religious mythologies. Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina, the nations most involved in the military conflicts from 1991 to 1995, have undergone a marked desecularization on the societal, organizational, and individual levels. From some perspectives, it might appear that Slovenia is an exception to this trend, as its transition to independence did not trigger a desecularization factor or what Steve Bruce termed ―cultural defence‖. But nevertheless we can speak in all of these cases of the essentially altered social position of atheism. If it was privileged before, it is now affected by strengthened and emboldened church ideologies. We observe in both Slovenia and Croatia the re-emergence of certain traditional attitudes toward atheism, which Colin Cambell, in his Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, called Victorian prejudices (Cambell, 1974). For this reason, I have undertaken in recent years the empirical testing of the following theses that have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral, and; 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Church about educated Slovenians and Croatians are unsubstantiated. Especially in Slovenia, both ―conviced atheists‖ and ―natural atheists‖ show (according to their own statements) above-average happiness, above-average reflection on life, above-average moral rigour and are less distanced from various social minorities. The reasons for such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia and Croatia on the other. The dialectic relationship between these two phenomena justifies (once again) the conclusion that the sociology of religion must incorporate the sociology of non-religiosity/irreligion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Belief in science and in the “Da Vinci Code”: Measuring naturalistic beliefs and its cognitive correlates,Miguel Farias,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper describes the development of a scale of naturalistic beliefs by the author of the paper, in collaboration with philosophers Guy Kahane and Nick Shackle, and the historian of science John Hedley Brooke. Preliminary validation of the scale was carried out with a sample of religious and atheist students (N = 130), that also filled in a number of other measures, including belief in ideas put forward in the best-selling ―Da Vinci Code‖ novel, knowledge of the Bible, and standardised cognitive and personality scales. I will present and discuss the newly developed scale on naturalistic beliefs as a way of tapping into contemporary atheists' ideas and attitudes, particularly related to the value attributed to science in understanding the world. I will also discuss some apparently contradictory evidence suggesting that atheists have higher scores both on ―need for cognition‖ and ―Da Vinci Code beliefs‖ than religious people.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Dimensions and types of non-religiosity: Scale development in progress,Nicholas Gibson,University of Cambridge,England,M,Claire White,University of Oxford,England,F,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"We are unaware of any scale or instrument that can be used to distinguish among types of non-religious individuals. Although various labels exist to describe non-religious and secular positions (such as atheist or agnostic), these are often misunderstood or misapplied by laypersons. Even where they are correctly used it is clear that—for example—atheists differ in their emotional responses to religion, their intellectual interest in religion, and their behavioural repertoire with regard to religious individuals and institutions. Rather than attempting to generate a typology from philosophical grounds we see merit in allowing a typology to emerge empirically, thus tapping nonreligiosity as it is lived. This paper will present data from a 24-item scale intended to capture dimensions of non-religiosity within a sample of 131 British adult subjects selfdescribing as atheists or agnostics. Four potential dimensions of non-religiosity emerging from factor analysis will be examined together with an exploration of potential types of non-religiosity that emerge from cluster analysis of subjects.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Christo-secular ambivalence in British security policy, 2001-2009,Stacey Gutkowski,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although secularism has recently become a site of analysis for international politics, it has as yet received little theoretical elaboration in the area of security studies. A new research programme is needed to further this end, one that is not merely a secondary addendum to the existing one on religion and security. This paper suggests some directions for that research agenda, that turns to examine how trajectories of secularization and non-religion in Britain impacted on security policy towards radical Islam between 2001-2009. It seems that a kind of Christo-secular ambivalence has afflicted British security policy, both in the case of threat perception and the management of risk.

The challenge of popular religion to atheism: a socio-cognitive approach,Steven Sutcliffe,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a recent British opinion poll, 64% (n=1000) believe that ‗some people have powers that cannot be explained by science', 49% believe in ghosts, and 41% believe in communication with the dead. Earlier Gorer (1955), in a survey conducted in an English newspaper, found equally robust levels of belief in ghosts, reincarnation and horoscopes. The ‗new age' or ‗holistic' milieu is similarly fecund (Sutcliffe 2003, Heelas and Woodhead 2005). I argue that such qualitative evidence in the UK (for example) suggests that – despite apparent triumphs of secular modernity - religious belief and practice is alive and well in its popular, ‗theologically incorrect' (Barrett 1999/Slone 2004) expressions. These expressions support more complex, synthetic and/or discursive forms of ‗religion', making the articulation of ‗religion' in ordinary, everyday life settings appear unremarkable and ‗natural'. On this evidence, modernity and popular religion are not mutually exclusive, secularization has in-built limitations, and atheism – defined as predicating social identity on denial of god(s) - is likely to remain a pursuit of intellectual minorities. I argue that ‗folk' narratives and models are a better guide to what ‗religion' is like at the point of production than sophisticated and abstracted reflections produced by specially trained elites (whether religious or secular). They also point to the persistence and longevity of ‗religion' insofar as cognitive representations generated below the level of conscious awareness instinctively reinforce socially constructed discourses. The elementary forms of ‗religion' are thus co-produced by cognitive processes in human brains operating in synchronization with sociological forces of order and legitimation. Atheism is likely to find this popular double act hard to breach.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
A British secular–religious cleavage?,Stratos Patrikios,University of Strathclyde,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The growing visibility of secular commentators and organisations in Britain is often regarded as evidence of a cultural conflict between ‗the Secular' and 'the Religious'. Two key assumptions underlie this popular account: that there is growing disagreement between the two groups, and that each group is a homogenous actor that can be mobilised against the other. But are these assumptions supported in reality? For instance, can we meaningfully speak of a 'secular' camp on cultural issues? The paper answers these questions by examining whether the controversy we see in the media reflects a divide at the mass level. The analysis uses survey data to model distributional measures of public opinion over time (1983-2007). Two types of social attitudes are examined: positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relations. Results identify a widening gap between the non religious and the religious (esp. Anglicans) regarding attitudes towards homosexual relations. This widening gap is a function of the differential rate of liberalisation that has affected both groups. However, if the gap is to be consequential for social and political developments, each competing group should be growing increasingly homogenous. Findings suggest that there is no such trend in the internal coherence of the two groups.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
The good atheistic Samaritan: Intrinsic, extrinsic and quest atheism and its relationship with prosocial behaviour,Sven Oelsner,University of Jena,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary psychological research concerning the relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour shows an ambiguous picture. Some researchers found a correlation between religiousness and helping behaviour (Bernt, 1989; Hansen, Vandenberg, & Patterson, 1995; Sappington & Baker, 1995) where others did not (Darley & Batson, 1973; Smith, Wheeler, & Diener, 1975; Sundeen & Raskoff, 1995). In studies documenting positive effects religiousness was frequently investigated with qualitative measures such as the intrinsic, extrinsic and quest religiosity scales proposed by Batson (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991). These scales are based on underlying constructs covering social activities, philosophical thinking, ritualistic behaviour and worldview scepticism practiced by atheists and theists alike. However, terms specifically associated with Christianity (e.g. church, prayer, bible) increase the item difficulty for atheists and generate variance in the theistic sample only. The study to be presented investigated the question whether religiosity scales measure theistic/ supernatural beliefs or rather social, cultural and philosophical activities. The results indicate that the supposed relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour is not based on theistic religiosity (i.e. belief in the existence of supernatural beings) but rather on sociocultural attitudes shared by theists and atheists.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
Methodological challenges in understanding different modes and locations of irreligiosity,Teemu Taira,University of Leeds,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper demonstrates how to make use of existing survey data on religion when studying Atheism and irreligiosity. I shall suggest that it is useful to make a distinction between Atheism (as an identity tag) and general irreligiosity (for example indifference). This is especially so, because the current debate on New Atheism is dividing the irreligious: some identify themselves as atheists while others refuse to do so. Furthermore, it is helpful to study the phenomenon by not simply looking at beliefs but also identification, attitudes, participation, private practice and membership (including reflections on future membership). The importance of these distinctions lies in an attempt to construct a coherent picture of the varying modes and locations of Atheism and irreligiosity. It also may change the way the issue is dealt with more generally, because in public discourse these distinctions are often neglected. Although my research is focused on public discourse in Britain and Finland, in this example I will focus upon Finnish society. I shall suggest, however, that the methodological strategies can be applied to all societies where Western-style discourse on religion exists. Instead of simply attempting to explain the Finnish situation by referring to meaningful sociological variables such as education, gender, class, age and region, I shall combine the survey data – World Values Survey, Church Monitor and Gallup Ecclesiastica (1995–2005) – with systematically collected newspaper material to offer an interpretation of the Finnish situation. Two observations will be made: firstly, Finnish people are belonging (to religious organisations because of others) but not practising (themselves); secondly, they are rather irreligious (indifferent, non-religious) but not self-identifying Atheists. The connection between these two observations will be discussed.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.
The 'return of religion' and the return of the criticism of religion: The 'New Atheism' in recent German and American culture,Thomas Zenk,Free University of Berlin,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Criticism of religion can be found throughout the ages, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. It appears that history of religions itself can be interpreted as continued criticisms of one religion against another (e.g. Christianity as criticism of Judaism and Mediterranean pagan polytheism, Buddhism as criticism of Hinduism and so on) or within one religion (phenomena such as reform movements, fundamentalism etc.). Both, in intra-religious as well as inter-religious criticisms the frame of religion is not transcended. An explicit non-religious criticism of religion, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the history. It can be traced back to the European Age of Enlightenment. Nowadays, atheistic or even anti-religious voices have returned and the books by the so-called 'New atheists' (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett) are all bestsellers and were widely and vividly discussed. Both, the theses and arguments of the 'New atheists' as well as their public reception are examined in the course of a research project at the Free University of Berlin. Our project aims to analyze these two aspects in a historical comparison of the situation in Europe and the United States. By means of a discourse analysis, we hope to gain insights about the relations between what is called ―the return of religion‖ (Riesebrodt) and the return of the criticism of religion. At the 2009 NSRN our first findings will be presented.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.,.

We need an interpretive method to allow us to analyse cross-culturally and compare what belief means to different people in different places at different times. Analysing belief holistically and organically helped me to resolve the 'census question' puzzle: why would so many non-religious people choose to claim a Christian identity on the UK census?

Deconversion from Islam and declaring oneself non-religious is both legally and socially highly problematic. My fieldwork in Cairo has been conducted among individuals that overwhelmingly know each other through the internet, and have formed discussion groups with like-minded individuals both on- and offline. These groups and meetings provide a space to speak freely about ideas that are normally off-limits among family, friends or colleagues.

Such developments compound the need for greater critical comprehension of lived experiences of secularism, as highlighted by leading scholars including Professor Linda Woodhead, at the AHRC Innovative Methods in the Study of Religion conference (2010; also Asad 2009, Cannell 2010). Accordingly I shall conduct the first ethnographic study of explicit public enactments and experiences of secularism and nonreligious values in the UK, interrogating contemporary notions of secularism and its entanglement with religious practice. I will focus on individuals and groups in Britain mobilising publicly around values of non-religion and secularism, exploring their ritual symbolism, verbal and visual language; I will document the range of emergent material forms, rituals and networks using visual ethnographic methods (Banks 1999, Pink 2001). Preliminary research into the 2008 “Atheist Bus Campaign”, initiated in direct response to religious advertising campaigns, highlighted the significance of visual and verbal non-religious performance, including advertising and networking locally and internationally through new media.

As a literary scholar I meanly analyze fiction and to some extent film, but I also catch try to catch a glimpse of apocalyptic prophecy in science. In a postmodern context the concept of the end has changed fundamentally. There seem to be not just one end, but a plurality of possible ends: The End of history, the end of class struggle, the end of philosophy, the death of God, the end of religions, the end of Christianity and morals […], the end of the subject, the end of man, the end of the West, the end of Oedipus, the end of the earth, Apocalypse now […]”. (Derrida 1983). Some key questions concerning the “secularized apocalypse” are: In a secularized age thinking the end is not any more a practice restricted to religion. Scientific models dominate our picture of the end of the world. Wars, ecological disasters, and cosmic catastrophes have the power to destroy the world as we know it. In this context apocalypse becomes an umbrella term for many phenomena which all have in common a complete or near complete destruction of the world. In a biblical sense from this point a renewal of the world would happen. But is this the case in a secularized apocalypse? What happens after the Day X if there is no hope for an intervention from god?

I‟m using oral histories and autobiographies to reveal how people described their own loss of faith and the age at which this occurs. In the last ten years the social history of religion in Britain has been dominated by the idea that the 'religious crisis' of the 1960s marked a watershed in the dechristianisation of Britain. Historians have suggested a variety of causal explanations for this, however, atheist apostasy is not amongst them. My work shows that apostates dechristianised from the beginning of the century and unbelief spread in the non-elite population until it was able to find expression in public discourse during the social revolution of the 1960s. In the preceding decades there were atheistic sub-cultures such as radical politics or university education which allowed some to realise their unbelief, yet others rejected religion with little apparent external influence.

In the latter, which ran from 2006- 2009, and focused on an ecumenical, evangelical charity devoted to promoting the Bible and its image, I became increasingly interested in what many evangelicals see as their public-sphere foils: secular humanists. Indeed, in much of the work for this project, secular humanists, 'atheist fundamentalists,' and other such figures--real and discursive--played a significant role. It struck me that an ethnography of humanism in the UK would be a good follow-on project, and that's exactly what I plan to do starting this January, when I begin ESRC-funded fieldwork on the British Humanist Association. Although I have yet to do sustained research on humanism, I am interested, at the methodological level, in several issues, such as how categories like 'belief' figure differently (or not) than in research on Christians, and how the dynamic between individuals and institutions plays out within a movement that is driven by traditions of 'free thinking.'",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

Yet it is rarely noted that nonreligious viewpoints are frequently expressed in the regular ridicule of religion (atheism and secularism receive comparatively little attention). But this study found that religion is ridiculed in significantly different ways. My research looks at six comedianS: Eddy Izzard, Dara O‟Briain, Dylan Moran, Ricky Gervais, Stewart Lee and Marcus Brigstocke. The former three ridicule flaws in religious people. But crucially they also ridicule these traits in non-religious people. The ultimate target of their ridicule is distinction between the religious and non-religious. They laugh with those they ridicule. The latter three, by contrast, ridicule traits from a position of superiority. Their target is an outsider group that they distance themselves from. They do not sympathise with religious people but laugh at them. The evidence of this diversity adds empirical substance to postsecularist critiques and so undermines a common discourse that conceives of ridicule as a homogeneous form. The differences between these forms are essential to understanding the sociological implications of the ridicule of religion, particularly in poorly understood political events such as the Danish Cartoons.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.,.

It aims to address the area of young people and secularism, providing original data on young people‟s experiences and perceptions of non-religion (secularism, atheism, humanism etc) and religion and how they think their secularist participation relates to their wider lives.

The basic goal of the chapter is to get a sense of what the ordinary, everyday lives of Nones are: what do they do instead of go to church, what are their hobbies, how do they derive their ethics and morals, how do they think about religious people, and how do they manager their non-religious identity in a predominantly religious society like the U.S. There have been a number of studies that have focused on Nones and seculars who are affiliated with pro-secular or pro-atheist groups, but nothing, to date, that focuses on nones without this connection, and particularly on their everyday lives.

One method I hope to utilise is video diary and video elicitation interviews. Basically, this will be a project seeking to identify the benefits people accrue through celebrating Christian festivals in a secular context, including a consideration of familial ties, nostalgia, consumerism and gendered work (such festivals involve a huge amount of planning and organisation, where traditional gendered divisions of labour may be reinscribed, despite increased egalitarianism in other spheres). It is thus focusing on religion and secularism at a cultural crossroads, where the religious and the secular are at an intersection or boundary, embedded in each other, but where politics of meaning are fraught and contested (Knott 2005). This is borne out by the Christian distaste of Christmas consumerism, often portrayed in outlets such as the 'Church Times', or by the incongruence in popularity of Christmas carol services, where cathedrals and churches are filled to the brim with participants who may never set foot into a church at any other time of year. Although studies addressing the popular salience of Christian festivals in a secular context have been addressed in the United States (E.g.

Disenchanting India qualifies this representation through an analysis of the contemporary Indian rationalist organisations (those that affirm the values and attitudes of atheism, humanism or free-thinking).To understand the genesis of organised rationalism in India the book addresses the rationalists’ emphasis on maintaining links to atheism and materialism in ancient India and outlines their strong ties to the intellectual currents of modern European history. At the heart of Disenchanting India lies an ethnography of the organisation “Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti” (Organisation for the Eradication of Superstition) based in Maharashtra. This account describes the organization’s efforts to promote a scientific temper and combat the beliefs and practices it regards as superstitious. It also includes an analysis of rationalism in the day to day lives of its members and in relation to the organization’s controversial position within Indian society.The book outlines the distinguishing characteristics of this organisation through a depiction of the rationalists’ specific “mode of unbelief” in comparison to “modes of religiosity”. Alongside a critical engagement with the work of Max Weber and Charles Taylor, the theoretical discussion of modes of unbelief further provides an original basis for comparative studies of similar movements in a trans-cultural perspective. Finally, Disenchanting India can be situated within the contemporary debates about the nature of rationalism in Indian intellectual life and cultural politics. It thereby engages with debates that are as crucial for Anthropology and Religious Studies as they are for Post-colonial Studies, Sociology and History.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.,.

Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lanman argues that atheism – like religion in Boyer‟s account – is not an evolutionary byproduct. Instead, its distribution can be explained by „human-nature‟ (aspects of our evolved psychological make-up) in interaction with the socio-cultural contexts in which we live. Lanman guides us through this hypothesis. There is, he said, a large body of evidence against the idea that humans come to our understandings solely through a process of rational reflection. Instead, we see patterns in random occurrences; we often fall prey to our own confirmation bias, tending to look for evidence to confirm our views and rarely looking for evidence to disprove it. Rather, „rationality‟ is usually used to describe a normative vision of how we should think a view prevalent in contemporary Atheist and Humanist discourse. Yet rationalism fails as a general explanation for nonreligious normative stances, instead we need to look to socio-cultural. Lanman‟s ultimate view is that neither belief or non-belief are natural; we need to start from a view that our behaviour is mostly unconscious and our brains are wired to numerous specialisms which can be affected without damaging the overall intelligence or other specialist functions.",2011,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

The argument is that being precise about different forms of contingency is useful in itself – and are meaningfully distinct regardless of how their NSRN Glossary contingent terms are understood.

Defining 'Atheism’: A Modest Proposal,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lois Lee’s draft glossary provides us which much – and valuable – food for thought. However with one definition, at least, I find myself in disagreement: Atheism – a conscious or unconsious lack of commitment to God(s) (2011: 2) Commitment strikes me as a problematic and ambiguous category. Is this a lack of intellectual commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of commitment to (the idea that there exists [a]) God(s)’ ? Or a lack of what one might term an existential commitment – e.g., 'a... lack of (personal, devoted, trusting?) commitment to God(s)’? The former might imply the latter, but the same is not true vice versa. It can be argued that while a great many Britons have at least some kind of intellectual commitment to the idea of God existing (even if this commitment extends only to ticking the requisite box on sociologists’ surveys), comparatively few have the kind of existential commitment to God(s), traditionally expressed through regular prayer, attendance at religious services, etc. This ambiguity could, of course, be clarified fairly satisfactorily. However, I believe a far better and usable definition of 'atheism’ – one already in scholarly use – can be located in the category not of 'commitment’, but of 'belief’. What I want to do in this short paper, then, is simply to outline what I believe to be a fairly uncontroversial definition of atheism already in scholarly use: 'a lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods’. While I will be presenting a case for the utility of this definition, I do not intend to do so in any exhaustive, defeat-all-comers way.

Cross-national data relating to social, political, economic and cultural aspects of life were tested for correlation with religiosity/secularity. In contrast to the most widely accepted general account of secularity, the Existential Security Framework (ESF; Norris & Inglehart, 2004), secularity was not most highly related to material security, though these were highly related. Rather, secularity was most strongly related to the degree of formal education attained. Material security explained no significant variance beyond education. Thus, religion’s primary function in the world today is being replaced, not so much by the pseudo-materialistic supplication for better living conditions as posited by the ESF, but by contemporary education – extensive knowledge of contemporary cultures, philosophy, modes of thought or processes of reasoning.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.

However, much of this scholarship relies on two critical and largely unaddressed assumptions: (a) that when people report negative attitudes toward atheists, they do so because they are reacting specifically to their lack of belief in God; and (b) that survey questions asking about attitudes toward atheists as a group yield reliable information about biases against individual atheist targets. To test these assumptions, an online survey asked a probability-based random sample of American adults (N = 618) to evaluate a fellow research participant (“Jordan”). Jordan garnered significantly more negative evaluations when identified as an atheist than when described as religious or when religiosity was not mentioned. This effect did not differ as a function of labeling (“atheist” versus “no belief in God”), or the amount of individuating information provided about Jordan. These data suggest that both assumptions are tenable: nonbelief—rather than extraneous connotations of the word “atheist”—seems to underlie the effect, and participants exhibited a marked bias even when confronted with an otherwise attractive individual.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.

In this lecture, I address these questions by drawing on fieldwork among humanists in Britain, paying particular attention to humanism’s relation to Christianity. In one way or another, humanists often position themselves in relation to Christianity. In a basic way, this has to do with humanists’ commitment to secularism—the differentiation of church and state. In more complex ways, though, it also has to do with an effort to move “beyond” Christianity—to encourage a world in which reason takes the place of revelation—while often, at the same time, recognizing what’s worth saving and even fostering from the legacies of faith. All these various relations and perspectives suggest how we should understand social life in contemporary Britain as what it is in spite of Christianity—and not.",2012,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

In addition, those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religious preference as adults. Despite their growing numbers, individuals raised with no religion have received little attention from scholars. The adult religious preferences of these individuals provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test theories of religion and social change. Using General Social Survey data, I examine the adult religious preferences and beliefs of individuals raised with no religion. I provide evidence of a shift in socialization and social influences experienced by those who report growing up with no religion. Compared with earlier cohorts raised with no religion, more recent cohorts have had more secular upbringings and tend to be more secular, liberal, and wary of organized religion as adults. They are also more likely to have a religiously unaffiliated spouse, if they marry at all. Results from a logistic regression analysis indicate that these trends explain much of the cohort differences in the likelihood of remaining unaffiliated as an adult.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.,.
Functionally Secular / Substantively Nonreligious: Scottish Students, their Secular Sacreds, the Sacred Secular,Chris Cotter,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The academic study of religion and related categories is populated with reified, mutually constitutive, and superficially synonymous dichotomies – religion/secular, sacred/profane, sacred/secular, religion/nonreligion – yet each serves a distinct, contextually dependent purpose. In this presentation I shall utilise a case study amongst notionally ‘nonreligious’ undergraduate students, in combination with a discussion of these dichotomies, to problematise the complex relationship between nonreligion and the secular. When asked about their beliefs and ‘religious’ identities, many of these students were substantively nonreligious (utilising Lois Lee’s understanding of nonreligion as defined primarily by the way it differs from religion). This nonreligiosity manifested itself in divers ways, dependent upon idiosyncratic interpretations of ‘religion’, and always linked to particular ‘secular sacreds’, which corresponded to five distinct-yet-overlapping nonreligious types. Individual narratives exemplify pragmatic negotiation of nonreligious identities, ‘fluctuation’ in nonreligious beliefs, and the rhetorical creation of religious ‘others’ against which substantive nonreligiosity was  constructed. In terms of salience and practice, many of these students appeared functionally secular i.e. ‘being nonreligious’ was generally unimportant and had little impact upon day-to-day life. However, the interaction of religion with personal sacreds precipitated the recognition and reaffirmation of subjective nonreligiosity. In many cases, the sacred in question was the ‘secular’ itself, which was profaned by the incursion of religion into individual narratives. This overview of the complex dynamics between these terms provides empirical clarification of the relationship between nonreligion and the secular, and demonstrates that nonreligion is a substantive phenomenon in its own right and, as such, an important component of secular society.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.
Questioning the invisibility of non-religion in the contemporary workplace: a process of accommodation?,Mark Read,Goldsmiths College,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper is based upon an interim analysis of a PhD study into the contemporary workplace as seen through the eyes of twenty Quaker interviewees. It questions whether ‘religion’ or ‘nonreligion’ descriptors can be meaningfully applied to modern work organisations. This analysis of the research data is based upon viewing organisations as processual, rather than fixed and structured, entities. Organisations are understood as a confluence of individual, subjective, meaning-making and processes of identity accommodation. (Parker, 2008) Taking the view that subjective identities are fundamentally grounded beyond the organisational form, and articulated at the point of multi-various decision-making within the job role, analysis of the data suggests that the interviewees’ complex motivations remain largely invisible in organisational terms. The interviewees can be regarded as engaging in private articulations of multi-faceted personal beliefs within a locus of public discourse. Within this discourse, Quaker belief is a singular, variously significant aspect of the interviewees’ subjective identity. However, engagement with the requirements of the work role, and contestation of organisational norms in the particular, reveal a more complex articulation of the subjective self that undermines a religious/non-religious binary definition. The paper concludes that individuals in modern, technical-rational organisations (Bauman, 1989) bring a multi-faceted subjectivity to their work which cannot be recognised readily within formal organisational discourses. It suggests finally that subjective identities are organisationally significant, and through their religious/non-religious invisibility, have the potential to shape, unrecognised and fundamentally, the identity of the collective whole.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.
The Rise of the People of No Religion,Callum Brown,Dundee University,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the 1950s during her teenage years in England, a woman later recalled, she proclaimed in the school playground her non-belief in God, and for her breach of childhood rules was taunted by her classmates and called a heathen. The 1950s was a decade when there were varying degrees of difficulty almost everywhere in the western world for somebody to proclaim oneself as an atheist. It was especially difficult for a woman, upon whom high expectations were placed for setting a moral and religious standard which would lead, ultimately, to providing the headship, as mother and wife, for the respectability and proper Christian upbringing of a family. In the sixty years since, there has been a remarkable change. The new-found freedom of the individual to proclaim an absence of religious belief and practice has been one of the greatest cultural changes which mark out our modern times. The extent to which the people of the West have become free from religion varies between nations and even within nations, sometimes enormously. But the trend is nonetheless widespread and very marked. Susan Budd ended her history of unbelief in England at 1960, at the very point when no-religionism started to explode in western culture. It is time to take the story forward, and to reflect on this massive alteration, and to transform the way we consider no religion – from consideration of the minorities who have no faith, to analysis of the development of those who form the majorities in some nations of the early twenty-first century. In 2005, 52 % of Europeans said they believed in God; but, as we shall see, even before 2000 a majority in some nations did not adhere to a religion. This article explores the social history of the rise of the people of no religion in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, and the United States with additional evidence from Australia and New Zealand, mainly covering the period from 1950 to 2010 but with some additional review of available evidence stretching back to 1900. After reflecting on the state of existing knowledge in the field, it will explore problems of definition. Using statistics, it will then make a quantitative evaluation of the patterns of growth in the numbers of no-religionists in the above countries, and then inquire more deeply into some demographic patterns observable from the data. The aim is to begin the construction of a narrative of the history of no religion.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.

Multiple Secularities: Toward a Cultural Sociology of Secular-Religious Distinctions,Monika Wohlrab-Sahr,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For more than two decades sociological debates over religion and secularization have been characterized by a confrontation between (often American) critics and (mostly European) defenders of secularization theories. At the same time, there was a remarkable rise in public debates about the role of secularism in political regimes and in national as well as civilizational frameworks. Against this backdrop this paper presents the conceptual framework of “multiple secularities” with a view to refocusing sociological research on religion and secularity. We will demonstrate that it can stimulate new ways of theorizing the relationship of religion and secularity in a variety of modern environments. Arguing for a reformulation of this relationship within the framework of cultural sociology, we conceptualize “secularity” in terms of the cultural meanings underlying the differentiation between religion and non-religious spheres. Building on Max Weber we distinguish four basic ideal-types of secularity that are related to specific reference problems and associated with specific guiding ideas.

Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,Brian Nathan,University of Tampa,Florida,M,Kristina Cappello,University of Tampa,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Karel Dobbelaere has argued that secularization occurs at three levels – the macro or nation-state level, the meso or institutional level, and at the micro or personal level.  To date, there are no clear measures to capture secularization at any of these levels.  There are many measures that are designed to capture individual-level religiosity and spirituality, but none to measure how nonreligious someone is.  There are also no measures of how religious or nonreligious institutions are.  This is of particular concern in light of the fact that a growing body of research compares faith-based charitable organizations to secular charitable organizations for efficacy in provision of services yet there is no universal way to measure how religious or nonreligious these institutions are.  In this paper we present initial validation of a scale measure designed to capture how religious or nonreligious institutions are.  The measure was developed primarily by the lead researcher but was then refined through a focus group involving students and other experts.  Once the measure was developed, the researchers visited 12 separate institutions (4 religions, 4 charities, and 4 for-profit corporations).  At each institution, the researchers interviewed between 1 and 6 people who were involved with the institution.  The researchers also spent several hours observing the institutions in an effort to discern the level of religiosity of the institution.  Responses on the measurement instrument illustrate strong inter-item reliability and suggest a single underlying factor.  Recommendations for employing the instrument at other institutions are included.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.
The secular, the non-religious and the sacred: developing a framework for analysis,Rebecca Catto,Lancaster University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent sociological work related to the study of religion has involved decoupling the sacred from the religious in order to illustrate how the modern world is far from desacralized. Gordon Lynch in his recent book The Sacred in the Modern World develops a neo-Durkheimian frame and shows how we identify with multiple sacred forms in late modern society. He rejects a distinction between religious and secular sacreds as meaningless. The point is well taken that the religious and secular do not constitute a true binary. Nonetheless, in this paper, Kim Knott's concept of the secular sacred is taken as analytically productive in the study of non-religious identities. The secular-religious distinction continues to have social force. As outlined in a recent chapter written with David Martin, the secular and religious are mutually constitutive, and the religious and non-religious may be taken to be in a similar dynamic relationship. Building upon this work, here I propose a theoretical framework incorporating work on the sacred and secular-religious interactions for analysis of the non-religious. This helps to connect the individual and societal and transcend any misconception that 'the secular' is a neutral space free from non-negotiable values.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.
Conversion to nonreligion: why and how people become nonreligious,Sebastian Nastuta,Petre Andrei University of Ias,iRomania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a study published in the journal Secularism and Nonreligion, Stephen M. Merino indicated that „recent birth cohorts of Americans are more likely than previous cohorts to be raised outside of a religious tradition” and „those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religion as adults” (Merino, 2012). Unlike this study interested in those raised with no religion, we’ll try to identify in datebases like GSS, ISSP, EVS, WVS and ESS those people who declare themselves as nonreligious or atheists although they were raised in a religious tradition and had religiously afiliated parents. We intend to find out in this paper if we can discuss, forcing the concept, about a conversion to nonreligion. Who are those who became nonreligious? Why and how they become nonreligious? are some questions we’ll try to answer in our paper.

Othering and the theist/atheist dialectic,Marthe Kirkweik,Heythrop College,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The obvious answer to the question “what is an atheist?” is: someone who doesn’t believe in God. But that doesn’t get us any further if we don’t know what it means to believe in God. It takes knowing the meaning of hair to understand what it is to be bald. But whom should we ask what it means to believe in God? Theists or atheists? Both strategies might lead to very different answers. After all, a theist is likely to consent that a belief in God is meaningful, perhaps even necessary or rational, while an atheist will probably take a belief in God to be unnecessary, a human construct, perhaps even confusing, undesirable or irrational. In addition, both theists and atheists may be divided on the question of how to demarcate a believer in God from a non-believer in God. Is God something that does or does not exist, which would mean that the theist and the atheist disagree on a belief in God’s existence? (I will call this demarcation strategy the ‘God-existence’ strategy) Or is a belief in God more like a relation or attitude towards certain experiences or elements of human nature, like moral or aesthetic elements of life, which theists would identify with God, while atheists don’t? (I will call this the ‘God-experience’ strategy) And there are other possibilities. In this paper, I argue that clear demarcation strategies are in themselves political tactics and involve the danger of Othering, in a way much like Simone de Beauvoir discusses in The Second Sex. I will use the strategies I just mentioned, the ‘God-existence’ strategy and the ‘God-experience’ strategy, as examples.",2012,Conference,Nonreligion and the Secular: New Horizons for Multidisciplinary Research,.,.,.

In reality, a lot of the work that NS researchers undertake relates and refers to atheism and/or atheist cultures. But, in developing the network, we were conscious that we were situating this broader project not alongside and in relation to research into theism so much as alongside and in relation to a broader programme of research associated with the term ‘religion’. There are, after all, myriad ways of being nonreligious and multiple forms of secularity. What is more, atheism is not always a significant component of either experience, if it is a component at all. There are several possible reasons why ‘atheism’ might have become, by comparison, such a dominant identifier of nonreligiosity: An extension of the Protestant-centric emphasis on belief over practice? An expression of Cartesian dualism, with its emphasis on the mind as distinct from, and more important than, the body? But NS researchers are interested in other things too. We are interested in the nonreligious traditions that are driven by a sense of distance or otherness not from theism but from religious rituals, symbolic representations and communities. We are interested in why and when people – theist, atheist or otherwise – identify themselves as ‘atheist’, ‘nonreligious’, ‘not religious’, ‘secular’ or ‘agnostic’. We are interested in how people engage with nonreligious communities like many contemporary Humanist organisations and atheist groups. And we are interested in very much more besides."

Place and purpose in the world fulfilled by the interaction with other humans and explained by the revelations of science – albeit offered in layman’s terms. Enchantment may now be secular (material) but it has not gone away (Saler 2006).  In their book, What Matters? Ethnographies of Value in a not so Secular Age, Bender and Taves state that ‘Religion, Secularism and Spirituality become markers of value, as much or more so than they are containers of distinct kinds of actions or ideas. Positively, these terms may mark things, ideas and practices as self-evidently meaningful or link them with “higher”, more expansive aims. Negatively…they are marked as over-valued or wrongly linked to higher aims’ (2012: 10). The assembly implores us to Live better, Help Often and Wonder more.  Wonder is a value in these terms. The cosmologies of religion are negatively marked – it is the wrong answer to the question of the out there: it does not explain, it cannot be proved. Wonder on the other hand, is the mark of the secular – allowing us to ask questions, move forward, and access truth."
Does Atheist Movement Activism Increase Interest in Atheism?,Ryan T.

Having a few more statistical tools at my disposal than Silverman may have, I wondered if a more rigorous analysis of the data was possible and whether it would provide any insight into causality. The correlations between ‘atheist’ and ‘American Atheists’ have varied pretty substantially from year-to-year. That searches for the two terms are correlated meets one criteria of causality, but the other two remain to be established.  Temporal causality must also be established.  In no year was one variable’s lagged values a significant predictor of the other variable.  In other words, causality cannot be statistically determined between whether searches for ‘American Atheists’ cause searches for ‘atheists’ or vice versa. My inability to determine causality does not mean there is no causal relationship between American Atheist activism and interest in atheism.  From a logical and theoretical standpoint, it would make sense that there might be some causal relationship. But, as it stands, causality cannot be determined. Additionally, it is possible that other events influence both search terms."

Encounters with students who described themselves as ‘not religious’ led me to ask questions about the inclusion of secular philosophies within RE, and to undertake ESRC-funded doctoral research on the lives of young people of ‘no religion’. Despite the increasing amount of academic research on nonreligion (Lee and Bullivant 2010), much empirical research has focused on adults. Even the Young Atheist Research Project was mostly concerned with older teenagers and young adults who self-identified as ‘atheists, freethinkers, humanists, secularists or sceptics’. We therefore have very little understanding of the ‘silent majority’ who participate in, and are affected by, RE – and around whom this education is being designed. My own research, focusing specifically on younger adolescents attending secondary schools in England who all report having ‘no religion’, will contribute to this lacuna. By offering insights into the lives of these ‘young nones’, it will complement European-wide studies of young people’s perspectives on religion and religious education, such as those carried out by Knauth et al. (2008) as part of the REDCo project. It will also contribute to our understanding of the nature of nonreligion as an aspect of human life and society, investigating the extent to which young people have beliefs, identities and material expressions that can meaningfully be described as ‘nonreligious’. Questions surrounding nonreligion and young people are broad and pressing, and should not be forgotten within the emerging field of nonreligion and secularity studies."
Oh, the Irony!?: Studying Atheism in Religious Studies,Steven Tomlins,University of Ottawa,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Steven Tomlins discusses common misconceptions he has encountered as a researcher of atheism within a religious studies department, and highlights some of the potential benefits of studying nonreligion from a religious studies perspective.",2013,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The first part of my preface deals with a rather common misconception that Religious Studies is analogous to Theology.  This is simply not the case; while both deal with religious matters, Theology and Religious Studies are different disciplines with different histories, objectives, boundaries, theories, and methodologies. Although Religious Studies is a secular discipline, it does have its fair share of religious adherents, just as it has its fair share of nonreligious scholars.  For individuals in the field who have religious beliefs, it is often the case that those beliefs do not come to the forefront of their work. As for the study of atheism specifically, it fits well into Religious Studies because atheists are often engaged with discourse on or about religion; atheism, at the very least, is a reaction to, or negation of, theism.  In the last few years, likely attributable to media and public interest in so-called New Atheism (and, arguably, a New Atheist backlash), atheism has increasingly been studied in Religious Studies. The study of atheism seems to have become normalized within Religious Studies, but that does not mean studying atheism in Religious Studies is not without its concerns.  Care must be given, for example, not to conflate contemporary organized atheism with being a new or pseudo-religion just because it addresses religion and occasionally offers alternatives to concepts or practices that have long been considered the domain of religion.  It is also important to keep in mind that methods and theories utilized by Religious Studies scholars may not always apply to nonreligion (an umbrella term which includes many types or expressions of atheism but also those who identify as agnostic, humanist, apathetic, etc.).

Implicit Frameworks: The Tyrannical Hegemonic Discourse,Thomas J. Coleman III,University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,Tennessee,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Thomas J. Coleman III sets out a rhetorical argument promoting the notion of ‘implicit atheism’ as a means to critique the concept of implicit religion, highlighting problems that can arise when researchers employ ‘religious’ language in reference to nonreligious individuals.",2013,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"We desperately need a theory of ‘implicit atheism’, and not because we need to take implicit atheism seriously (it is a spurious concept), but because we need to demonstrate the negative hegemonic effect that ‘implicit religion’ (IR) has on the social scientific study of religion, non-belief in God and non-religion. In this post I argue against the framework / concept of IR in general and its potential application in studying non-religion by advocating for the development of ‘implicit atheism’ (jokingly so) to demonstrate that many ‘religious people’ can be labeled as ‘implicitly atheists’. What is wrong with the concept of ‘implicit religion’? The relationship between IR and what we are now forced to term as ‘explicit religion’ is of a tyrannical hegemonic nature. If we want to know what someone ‘believes’, or doesn’t, we have to ask them. We should consider this the nature of ‘belief”. There is no such inherent thing as ‘religion in general’ or a ‘religious act’ or ‘religious emotion’ (Belzen, 2010, p. 12, 32), only things deemed to be ‘religious’ by the person carrying out the act and or displaying the emotion (Taves, 2009). If there is anything that could be considered an inherently religious act or emotion, we know that this act or emotion can be fulfilled in secular ways as well (Vergote, 1997, p.45, cf. Hood, 1975)."

Pupils were asked to show me through photographs what is important in their lives, using the medium to represent people, places, objects, activities and times, as well as beliefs and values. Unlike other visual methodologies, photo-elicitation is often less concerned with the analysis and interpretation of the images per se (or with the quality of the images produced), and more concerned with the meanings and interpretations of those images expressed by participants. Following the photo-elicitation method, interview questions pursue and develop topics as they emerge in relation to pupils’ beliefs and values, their construction of meaning and purpose, and their identities and influences, as well as the material aspects of their lives. As researchers continue to study whether and how nonreligion is evident in the lives of people who report ‘no religion’, more clarity and greater understanding of this relatively new concept will develop. Thus far, much of the data emerging from this field has focused on adults who self-identify as ‘nonreligious’, but my research will complement existing studies on teenage religion and values (Francis and Kay 1995) by focusing on fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds who tick ‘no religion’, contributing to our current understanding of ‘nonreligion’ and other related concepts by demonstrating how these are manifest in the lives of ‘young nones’."

In addition to these activities, Camp Quest Montana included presentations on living a nonreligious life as well as a group discussion regarding the ways that science can enrich a person’s life. Focusing on gaining qualitative data I spent most of my time observing the participants, but did engage in informal interviews whenever possible, as well as organizing group discussions, one with the adults, including the parents of the campers and the camp organizers, and another with the teenagers.  I plan on carrying out follow-up interviews that will provide more detailed life histories and allow for one-on-one interaction. Whether or not the United States is filled with vocal and aggressive Christians is not actually relevant.  The important part to focus on is that the people at Camp Quest Montana feel that it was. The camp environment provided a space where participants could be nonreligious without any pressure to talk about why they were not religious. "
The Sociology of Irreligion: Past and Present,Colin Campbell,University of York,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It would be wrong to suppose that irreligion is a creation of the twentieth century. Although we are accustomed to hearing the age we live in described as the 'secular age’ or the 'age of doubt’, previous periods of history could justifiably be similarly labelled. To the Christians of the time, the last years of the Roman Empire must have seemed a time in which scepticism and heresy flourished, just as to the orthodox Christian of the eighteenth century the rise of Deism and the French Revolution indicated that he was living in an 'age of infidelity’. Even the Middle Ages, frequently treated as the epitome or an era of faith, was seen by medieval writers as a time of spiritual crisis, in which witchcraft, heresy and paganism were constant threats to the faith. The principal reason why our perspective of history is such that we view our own time as characteristically irreligious and contrast it with what we believe to be the prevailing faith of all previous epochs is because we live in the shade of the late nineteenth century. And it is the religious activity of that period which we tend to use as the yardstick by which to measure our own lack of faith.",2013,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

This is not an easy question to answer, and I am not sure I am best qualified to attempt to do so, but I can at least answer a not entirely unrelated question, which is how it was that I became interested in the topic of irreligion in the first place. In part the story is purely biographical, and relates to my involvement, at a relatively young age, in the Rationalist Press Association (the publishers of the magazine The Humanist), and subsequently the emerging British Humanist Movement. This meant that by the time I started my academic career in the early 1960s, I had direct personal experience of irreligious people and their organizations.

This claim was rejected but he was granted discretionary leave to remain until 2013 (Dugan 2014). Over the intervening years living in the UK – a country in which 65% of the population identify as having little or no religious orientation (Siegers 2010) – he gradually came to identify as an atheist. The Home Office accepted the claim made on the applicant’s behalf that there would be no way for him to conduct a discreetly nonreligious way of life in Afghanistan. While this is the first case on public record worldwide in which an atheist has been granted asylum on these grounds, Article 10 of the European Council’s 2011 treaty on asylum designates atheism as possible grounds for fear of religious persecution (Pizzi 2014). Commentators have suggested that this might set a new legal precedent both for the UK and other European countries.

Its assumptions are something that everyone knows, so only the outcasts have to make an effort to believe them.

NSRN director Stephen Bullivant offers his insights. ",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Back in the good old days, scholars working on atheism, secularity, nonreligion or related topics didn’t have to worry about how to start their articles or books. We were spared the struggle of thinking up zingy opening lines, because – more or less – we all used the same one. ‘No tradition for the sociological study of irreligion as yet exists…’, began Colin Campbell’s 1971 book Toward a Sociology of Irreligion. But that’s the trouble. The ‘Campbell opener’ has now appeared so many times – kicking off so many new studies of atheism/nonreligion – that it can no longer possibly be true. Curiously, all this has happened astonishingly fast. Tentatively now, I think two main things are going on. Firstly, I think atheism and nonreligiosity-in-general, as features of the social and cultural landscape, have simply become so large, obvious, significant and interesting, especially in Europe and North America, that they could not continue to be ignored. Secondly, I think that the growing self-awareness of atheists and ‘nones’ themselves, as a (loose) community or movement, has spurred the social scientists among them to take a closer ‘look in the mirror’."
Atheists and Secular Spirituality,Richard Cimino,Hofstra University,New York,M,Christopher Smith,Independent scholar,United States,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the latest post to the Nonreligion and Secularity’s special launch series’ Richard Cimino and Christopher Smith consider whether the idea of  ‘secular spirituality’ is really a plausible one.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Is there such a thing as a secular spirituality? A recent study found an interest in spirituality amidst a continuing secular drift in the UK. The survey (2013), sponsored by the Christian think tank Theos,  found that 77 percent of the British believe in some things that could not be explained by science and other means, and that only a quarter of those surveyed thought spiritual forces had no influence on the Earth. In other words, the study suggests that even many non-religious people don’t want to be categorized as strict materialists. But what about atheists? A secular spirituality for atheists would obviously not be related to the supernatural, yet the emotional components of wonder, awe, and joy might still be present in experiences deemed secular. According to our research on American atheists (or secularists, as we call them), we found a segment of them claiming a secular spirituality. This came through in a small Internet survey of 167 participants of atheist and humanist groups we conducted in 2010.  Although not representative of all organized secularists, the survey did illuminate the views of a significant segment of this diffuse movement, which was also evident in our content analysis of secular humanist publications. When asked if they ever felt awe, wonder, even transcendence in everyday activities, a significant percentage had such experiences while being in nature (59.2), working in or reading about science (47.9), performing or listening to music (47.3), admiring or doing art (41.9), and meditation/contemplation (35.3)."
What Do We Do When We ‘Do Life’?

This incident not only reveals friendly institutional relationships between atheist and open evangelical churches, but the description of the atheist congregation as gathering together ‘to celebrate life’ also opens up a wider point of connection. The Sunday Assembly, for example, describes itself as ‘a godless congregation that celebrates life’ and as ‘a global network of people who want to make the most of this one life we have. Our mission: to help everyone find and fulfill their full potential.’[i] This in many ways mirrors how members of both the open evangelical church and the charismatic evangelical church I am studying talk about ‘life’. Although ‘life’ and ‘reason’ may carry different resonances across these different groups, attending closely to particular concepts that are prominent in both religious and non-religious cultures may help deepen understanding of the specific affinities between different groups that we are often tempted to treat as separate."
Are Religion and Nonreligion All in the Mind?,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"NSRN director Lois Lee explains why researchers of nonreligion must look beyond purely intellectual and cognitive expressions of nonreligious rationalism.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The underlying rationalism has shaped the study of secularity and nonreligion hugely, encouraging investigation of abstract philosophical and political propositions. But emerging work shows how fruitful it is to think outside of this framework – to attend more equally to other dimensions and types of nonreligious culture, like the romantic forms of materialism which are quite distinct from rationalist ones; like the alternative spiritualities that sometimes understand themselves as meaningfully different to religion and which are nonreligious in that sense; or like the more expressly secular people, who are unengaged with philosophical orientations towards the world of any sort and instead derive meaning from this-worldly concerns and pleasures. A non-rationalist approach to nonreligious culture leads to investigations of how nonreligion threads through informal relationships, familiar symbolic environments and everyday practices; it extends ‘lived religion’ approaches to the study of nonreligious and secular life; and it considers how nonreligious identities of all kinds, whether rationalist or otherwise, are performed and received in private and public life. Alongside the intellectual and moral, then, we need to engage more deeply with the cultural and structural aspects of nonreligion. As all social scientists understand and feel deeply, thinking is really only one part of the picture."
The ‘Fuzzy’ Nones,Linda Woodhead,Lancaster University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last blog of the launch series Linda Woodhead discusses recent survey data which demonstrates the variations of opinions and beliefs among individuals who identify as having ‘no religion’; reminding us that just as ‘the religious’ do not conform to neat and tidy categories, neither do ‘the nonreligious’.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Abby Day and David Voas coined the term ‘fuzzy fidelity’ to refer to the large numbers of religious people who don’t conform to sociologists’ neat categories of what a ‘real’ religious person should look like. One of the striking things that emerges is that, far from all conforming to neat-and-tidy categories of ‘religious’ or ‘atheist’, a lot of nones are pretty fuzzy too. But against the idea that there is a growing tide of hard secularism we must set the finding that most ‘nones’ are not atheists. In fact atheism has been growing far less than ‘no religion’. Most nones don’t decisively reject God. What they reject is an identification with ‘religion’, with a particular religion, and with the label ‘religious’. We find that hardly any nones go to church or read holy scriptures, take any notice of religious authorities, or pray. Their most common spiritual practice is meditation or taking time to still the mind (18%). Some say they believe in God (16%), and almost a quarter that they are influenced by religion.  But the largest category are simply indifferent to religion. So the idea that most ‘nones’ are atheists who are implacably opposed to all forms of religion or spirituality is wrong. At the end of the day, the word ‘fuzzy’ as applied to either religious or non-religious people is useful only as  placeholder. It’s dangerous if it leads us to think there is something confused about the people to whom we apply the term. "
Atheists are Believers,Stephen LeDrew,Independent scholar,United States,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Stephen LeDrew asserts that atheism is not simply the negation or absence of religion but that it involves a complex array of epistemological, ethical and political beliefs.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Atheists are also ‘believers’. I would like to clarify what I mean by this, and how approaching the topic from this point of view leads us in different directions. Atheism is commonly defined as a negation or, more passively, a lack of belief. Smith implicitly adopts this view in his analysis of interview research that finds that atheism is a ‘rejection identity’, or a belief and an identity grounded in the rejection of religion in a theistically ‘ubiquitous’ socio-cultural context.  In my reply I argue that this approach is misleading, and that atheism should be approached as a set of complex systems of beliefs.  In LeDrew (2012) I identified two major historical categories of atheism that I call ‘scientific’ and ‘humanistic’. Major categories of beliefs found in the atheist movement today include (1) the view that science is the authoritative source of knowledge and that scientific progress drives social progress, and (2) a belief in basic human equality and a perception that religion impedes social justice.  In either case atheism is not just a negation or an absence of belief, but is connected to a set of epistemological, ethical, and political positions.  When it is institutionalized in social movement organizations or public discourse, then, atheism is ideology.  This is not surprising: given that atheists are not defined as a group by similar social characteristics and therefore are not united by a common experience of structural marginalization, what would motivate this level of organization and activism other than a passionate belief in something?"
The Divergent Discourses of Scientific and Humanistic Atheism,Lorna Mumford,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lorna Mumford reflects on how events during her field research suggest that different atheistic discourses are utilised in response to differing aspects of concern regarding religiosity.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In his journal article The Evolution of Atheism: Scientific and Humanistic Approaches Stephen LeDrew provides an analytical account of developments in official atheist discourses since the publication of D’Holbach’s Systeme de la Nature in 1770. He highlights how since the nineteenth century, there has been a divergence between atheist discourses based on scientific arguments and those based on humanistic concerns. LeDrew sees this difference reflected today in the scientific approach of ‘New Atheist’ authors such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, with their more confrontational response to religious belief and the promotion of science and education as a means to achieve increased secularization, and the approach of many secular Humanist organisations, who prefer a more accommodating approach and emphasise the importance of equal treatment for both religious and nonreligious worldviews. These two divergent discourses can, and do, operate in a complimentary way, with each informing and reinforcing the other, but these initial findings suggest that, rather than describing different people and groups, the two official discourses are used by the same people and groups but function in different ways, providing arguments and responses to two separate ‘dilemmas’ regarding religiosity: the propositional elements of personal religious belief, and the perceived impact religious practices and principles have on the lives of people in society."
‘Atheist Churches’ Aren’t New,Nathan G. Alexander,University of St Andrews,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The formation of the Sunday Assembly in London, and its offshoots in other parts of the world, have attracted the attention of the media; however, such types of nonreligious gathering are not entirely new. Nathan Alexander provides an overview of the historical forms of ‘atheist churches’, and highlights some of the issues faced by both old and new secular alternatives to religion.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The Sunday Assembly, an ‘atheist church,’ was formed in London in 2013, with offshoots in a number of cities in the UK, the US, and Australia soon following. These churches seek to replicate the ‘positive’ aspects of regular churches – the community, the ritual, the singing – only without the dogma. The media have taken notice of these churches, making irresistible comparisons of atheists with other religionists, most recently concerning a reported ‘schism’ between the London and New York chapters of the Sunday Assembly. What’s often missing from these kinds of media discussions, however, is that these atheist churches, and many of the dilemmas they face, are far from new. As people began to give up religion in significant numbers in nineteenth-century Europe and North America, many thinkers grappled with secular alternatives to religions, including what could be described as atheist churches. Perhaps the first attempt to transplant religious ideas into a secular framework occurred during the de-Christianisation of the French Revolution. A succession of cults dedicated to reason, to the ‘Supreme Being,’ and to theophilanthropy, sought to mimic the trappings of religion except in a deistic or atheistic guise. All these atheistic substitutes for religion have struggled with similar issues: How should they incorporate religious rituals and ceremonies while remaining secular? Should non-atheists be welcomed into their communities? How should these groups engage with political issues? Who has the authority to lead such congregations? How can these organizations build a foundation that will persist beyond a generation? These are questions that modern atheist churches struggle with – as, indeed, do many religious groups – and will only become more pressing as secularization continues and non-religious people seek to create new communities. Examining the experiences of past atheist churches might provide a guide for modern atheists as they begin to confront these issues."
Taking Atheism to School,Janet Betty Eccles,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Reflecting on her research among women atheists Janet Eccles highlights how encounters with religion in everyday life can shape experiences of lived nonreligiosity.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"To date little research has been focused on women atheists. Mahlamäki (2012) has argued that in many different contexts around the world, women have always been more religious than men and that men are more nonreligious and atheistic than women. This concerns every dimension of religion, be it belief, practice or belonging. Women are members of both traditional religious communities and new religious movements more often than men, although men have proved to be more resolute, apparently, than women as to religious beliefs. There are female atheists but their voices seem to have been heard rather less than men’s. In the conclusion to her article Mahlamäki makes the telling point that it is the everyday forms of nonreligiousness and lived nonreligiousness which are missing from public discussion. What do these look like? Obviously there are ‘everyday forms’ for both male and female atheists, but as so little research has been conducted on women, this seems a good place to start. Additionally, as Mahlamäki raises the issue of how children of nonreligious families experience the presence of (Christian) religion (festivals, prayers, hymns) in kindergarten or at school and, given that women still seem to be the main socialisers of their children into the family’s belief systems, it is likely that by studying women we will find some possible answers to these questions."
Atheism and Stigma,Siân Eleri Jones,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Siân Eleri Jones discusses the role of stigma, particularly self-stigma, in expressions of nonreligious self-identity. ",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"It has long been recognised that historically atheists were stigmatised and ostracised from the socially accepted and seemingly encompassing religionist norm. Although blasphemy laws in the UK were abolished in 2008, ingrained attitudes that are associated with them live on in the minds and actions of some. My purpose here is not to relay a chronology of the struggles atheists have faced, nor is it to advocate for the termination of perceived injustices towards atheists, but to consider the processes through which different forms of stigma arise, in particular the emergence of self-stigma. My ethnographic field-research involved immersing myself amongst self-identifying religious and nonreligious communities for an extended period of time. The results of this research exposed new ways of thinking about and understanding stigma in relation to atheistic identities. What became evident was the complexity of stigmatising behaviours. Stigma is not only imposed upon atheists by religionists but travels reversely from atheists towards religionists. Moreover, the multifariousness of religious and nonreligious communities means that stigmatisation also occurs amongst and between members of those communities. Consequently, incidences of stigmatising behaviour should be viewed less as an imposed injustice upon a minority group and more as a melee of stigma both created by, and creating, social divisions."

Though the researchers do mention the behavioural effects of believing in supernatural punishment for wrongdoing, they fail to directly connect people’s suspicion of atheists with the fact that atheists don’t believe in gods capable of such moral punishment. Given that research from Gervais, Shariff and Norenzayan (2011) concluded that distrust of atheists is in fact linked to concerns about atheists’ disbelief in a god monitoring their behaviour, the supposition that sacred texts and ethical norms form the boundary between the religious and irreligious is inadequate in explaining anti-atheist prejudice. I suggest investigating the effects of incorporating vignettes about atheists who consider themselves ‘spiritual’ and affirm some kind of karma-like moral monitoring in the universe. if the fear stems from an atheist’s lack of supernatural monitoring, then we would expect people to be more forgiving toward spiritual atheists. Clearly there is a wealth of potential research to be added to the good work conducted by Wright and Nichols."
‘Godless Cities’ and ‘Religious Enclaves’?

This tool can be used to see how ethnicity, age, levels of education, deprivation, self-rated health and many more variables are distributed across England and Wales. However, writing for The Guardian, Nick Mead drew attention to DataShine under the headline ‘Where do all the atheists live?’ claiming that the tool shows the ‘godless cities’ of England and Wales. However, the religious and nonreligious populations are not as segregated as these maps may imply.  It is important to remember that people selecting the option ‘no religion’ might not regard themselves as atheists. Some may be agnostic, or ‘spiritual but not religious’, or they might be undecided and exploring their religious options. Deciding how to describe this group of people is always difficult, but in general researchers today prefer the terms ‘religious nones’ or ‘no religionists’ to ‘atheists’."

There is a long tradition among nonreligious writers to assume that natural disasters undermine and refute religious belief. An example from Japan illustrates such a phenomenon. The work of the artist Koki Tanaka offers a nonreligious examination of how people respond to unusual situations and in the process must construct new attitudes towards meaning. By exploring this issue as a way to examine how people cope with disaster, his work resembles the process formerly associated with theodicy. These ‘Precarious Tasks’ highlight how issues of identity, meaning, and orientation towards the future are often profoundly disrupted by intense experiences of insecurity. The questions Tanaka explores thus resemble those formerly associated with religion in general, and theodicy in particular. These artworks bring into view how one of the challenges of our environmentally unstable era is to learn how to pattern our lives in the presence of ongoing threats and uncertainties. As such, Tanaka’s work can be understood as exploring the nature of ‘secular theodicy’."

This important question – for atheists and those who study atheism – is difficult to answer because it is not easy to see what the bluntness of the new atheists has in common with the subtlety of other philosophers of nonreligion, such as Richard Rorty or William Connolly. Instead of attempting to find a unifying theory of atheism, I have proposed, in a recent article published in Telos, that we need a dialectic theory of atheology. In terms of the theory of atheology, we can identify three such Hegelian moments in the history of atheism – and indeed in contemporary atheist discourse. The first movement is a largely negative one, which I label ‘a-theology’. What is a potential positive side of this atheology? Atheology can also be described as an atheo-logy, as the antithesis to the a-theology described above. This atheo-logy is a systematic understanding of the fight against particular understandings of God. The focus, I argue in the article, is between those who recognize atheism as a belief, and those who do not. The third phase can be labeled a ‘metatheology’, one that moves beyond (meta-) both theistic claims and, necessarily, simple atheistic claims as well. Atheology has not yet managed to move past these negative and positive phases, to build something radically different from what other religious doxa have built."

In brief, according to some surveys the Japanese populace seems secular, while measures of religious identification and church/shrine attendance suggest a vibrantly religious country. What is more, the average Japanese person belongs to not one, but multiple religions. By the conventional categories of Euro-American thought, Japanese have more religious diversity than they have people, and they lack ‘religion’ while frequently attending religious institutions. So how do we account for this apparently contradictory intersection of religion and secularism (no religion)? I’d like to turn to the history of the category ‘religion’ in Japan to find some answers to this puzzle. In sum, this means that while it is possible to talk about atheism, secularism, or nonreligion in Japan, one has to be careful not to import assumptions from the specifically Christian formulations of the category ‘religion.’ Moreover, I argue that the paradoxes are not in Japanese culture; so much as they highlight the contradictions of the concept of religion itself and push at the limits of its globalization."
God-blasters vs Philosophical Atheists: Real and Perceived Divisions Among Unbelievers,Elliot Hanowski,Queen’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Elliot Hanowski draws on the history of Canadian unbelief to argue that ideological labels should not overshadow the pragmatic way unbelievers of all stripes actually behaved when dealing with the broader society.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Ideas never stay pure and unadulterated when they spread through human societies. Likewise, ideological labels rarely reflect the pragmatic ways human beings appropriate, revise, and apply those ideologies based on the needs of the moment. Historians of nonreligion, who often trace the social history of ideas, need to be keenly aware of this fact. For example, the twentieth century saw a wide variety of labels applied to unbelievers: from rationalists, humanists and freethinkers, to secular socialists, anarchists and communists. Their diversity has been one reason that a unified social history of unbelief has been slow to develop. A broader approach is possible, but it will require historians to look at unbelievers not just as repositories of a particular intellectual formulation, but as people who took practical steps to navigate and contest a culture that was hostile to their views."
Religious ‘Nones’ Generally Have More Liberal Family Values in Areas of Greater Disaffiliation,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Using quantitative studies Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme discusses how religious nones demonstrate greater commitment to liberal family values in areas of high religious disaffiliation, impacting upon the value divide between the unaffiliated and their more religiously committed neighbours.",2014,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"It has been shown time and time again that the religiously unaffiliated (those who declare they have no religion when asked) tend to be more liberal in their views towards gender roles, sexuality and abortion compared with the religious in Western nations. Yet, with an almost universal rise in rates of non-affiliation across the West, little is known on how this effect has evolved. I attempt to shed some light on these questions with data from the 2008 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). To summarize, the unaffiliated are more liberal when it comes to family values in regions where they form larger groups. This creates a greater divide between the unaffiliated and the religiously committed in such areas. With most regions seeing an increase in their numbers of religious ‘nones’, this indicates that if they are not already characterised by this greater divide, they may be so in the near future. Since an individual’s value orientation tends to influence her/his political choices as well as other behaviour, these greater divides could be leading to greater social cleavages between the actively religious and the unaffiliated in many Western societies."
Building Bridges in the Shadows of Steeples: Active Atheists and the Negotiation of Community and Identity in a Theistic Culture,Aislinn Addington,University of Kansas,Kansas,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Atheists are an ideological minority in the United States. Atheists who actively seek out like-minded others are even fewer and farther between.

Findings suggest that boundary work in face-to-face community settings helps to crystallize individual and group identity as they navigate through a social world that, for the most part, disagrees with them. Like any ideological camp, the atheist movement, and the small organizations investigated in this study, encounter plenty of diverging opinions from inside their organizations as well. Additionally, this group utilizes new media and social networking online as a component of community as well as a platform for building and broadcasting identity. This paper begins the work of assessing if and how atheist use of online social networking affects their “real life” interactions with one another as well as with those who oppose their views.

While previous research suggests that nonbelievers are able to create images of divine figures, the content of these images had not been thoroughly investigated. We asked nonbelievers from the United States if they could form an image of a hypothetical divine figure. Of 520 participants, 81% were able to form an image of a divine figure. While images based on popular religious teachings were the most common, images based on previously held religious beliefs and other personal ideas were also reported. Participants then rated the characteristics of the hypothetical divine figure using the God-10, which measures the degree to which a divine figure is seen as cruel, distant, or loving. Compared to religious believers, nonbelievers described their imagined divine figures as somewhat crueler and substantially more distant and less loving. Participants later answered two questions about what they would say in an encounter with an imagined god and how this god would respond. Most participants did respond to these questions, and several themes emerged which paralleled the God-10 results. While many nonbelievers asked questions about the purpose of suffering and the god’s absence, there were few angry responses or accusations of sadism. These results show that nonbelievers can generate robust and informative images of a hypothetical god figure.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Organizational Variation in the Nonreligious Community,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With the rapid rise of religious non-affiliation in the United States over the past two decades, scholars have recently produced impressive work on the topic of nonreligion. However, little work has focused specifically on the role organized nonreligion plays in shaping a nonreligious identity, or the organizational variation that exists within the nonreligious community. How do different organizational types affect the development, maintenance, and salience of a nonreligious identity, and how might the individual and collective identities of members in turn affect organizational identity (i.e., the features that an organization is expected to possess)? My dissertation aims to uncover answers to these questions. I expect that a typology of nonreligious organizational identity can be developed, similar to the typologies of nonreligious individual identity currently being explored. This research will add to existing knowledge of nonreligion in the United States; American nonreligion is likely as diverse a phenomenon as American religion, and current research is only beginning to reflect this reality. I will investigate these topics using various qualitative methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews with nonbelievers, which will include a significant sample of nonbelievers who are not involved with a nonreligious organization, in order to control for the actual effect of organizational membership on nonreligious identity.

There is, in fact, a close connection between atheism and anarchism (see Fiala, 2013). Bakunin, for example, rejected both “God and the State.” However, in the contemporary world, secular political authority remains the best pragmatic mechanism for the development of nonreligion, since secular political systems defend the rights of nonbelievers. There is no denying, however, that the nonreligious standpoint is skeptical of unjustified authorities and traditions.

It shows that certain combinations of those three variables are far more common than others, and demonstrates changes over time in the percentage of people belonging to each cluster, with a trend toward diminishing religiosity. The paper identifies socio-demographic and geographic factors that are associated with the religiosity cluster to which a person belongs. The paper examines the ability of the new scale to predict how people will answer questions on contentious societal issues, using belief in evolution as a case study. The most religious definitely reject human evolution while the most secular definitely believe in it.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.
Organized Atheism in the US and Abroad – A Typology of Members from the Freethought-Secularist Movement,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"With this paper, I would like to present the main results from my research on members of atheist or secularist organizations in the United States and Germany. In a situation in which religious indifference and strict religiosity were shown to be growing simultaneously in the modern world, yet the phenomenon of convinced irreligion was largely ignored, I set out several years ago to answer the question: Who are the decided, committed, and organized atheists and what drives their activism in different socio-religious settings within Western societies? This research was completed in late 2013. The results are based on 58 qualitative in-depth interviews with members from local atheist organizations, which offer their members community as well as chances for participation in political activism and which are conceptualized as part of a broader freethoughtsecularist movement. Despite their highly diverse religious / nonreligious backgrounds and biographies, processes of joining, and strategies and degrees of activism, eight distinctive types of members were identified. These are based on recurring narrative and action patterns (“motives”). The motive of political conflict unites the “Political Fighter” and the “Indignant”, the motive of belonging unites the “Collectivist” and the “Alienated”, the motive 16 of philosophical and religious knowledge unites the “Intellectual Enlightener” and the “Silent Intellectual”, while finally the motive of identification with the organization is central to the “Dissociate” as well as to the “Euphoric”. These types show the face of organized atheism to be very diverse and to be much more than and different from the caricature of “militant atheists” that has dominated public perception of the movement in recent years (in much of whatever little notice it has received).",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
.,Caleb D. Spender,Azusa Pacific University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the heady days that followed the stunning success of The God Delusion, Letter to a Christian Nation, and the rest of the New Atheist works, it should come as little surprise that publishers determined that the moment was right to follow up these semiphilosophical works with the memoirs of atheists. For if, the reasoning seems to have gone, the reading public was ready to read strongly anti-religious works of the polemical type it stood to reason they would be interested in reading the stories of how people became atheists, especially in a book culture as saturated with memoirs as our own. But if the emergence of the atheist memoir is not that surprising, what is a little more surprising is the emergence of a whole new genre of spiritual autobiography, what I will call the “deconversion story,” in which the memoirist accounts for their loss of faith (usually in Christianity) in strikingly (and often self-consciously) parallel terms to the conversion narratives of that faith. So where one had come to Jesus before now one embraces atheism. Where there are a number of criticisms one might level against this structure (not least the rather strange instance of converting to a belief you don’t have) and against the New Atheist polemic more generally, these deconversion stories are particularly interesting given that so much of the New Atheist polemic (as noted by critics like David Bentley Hart and Terry Eagleton) is rooted in anecdotes and personal narratives rather than abstract argument. In addition to an engagement with the structural imperatives of the conversion narrative form, I argue recent discussions in cognitive science and psychology, especially debates about both memory and belief formation, may be helpful in understanding the form and especially the content of the deconversion narrative. In effect I suggest that these neurological axioms diagnose an etiology of one of the more perplexing trends in recent life writing about nonreligion: the degree to which conversion relies upon narratives of experience whereas deconversion seems to rely upon narratives of evidence.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Examining Low Religiousness Among University Students in Istanbul,Catherine Caldwell-Harris,Boston University,Massachusetts,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"College students in Istanbul are surrounded by considerable contradictions. The life-style of a cosmopolitan European city beckons, but family life frequently retains traditional values such as skepticism of western behaviors like dating. A key source of tension for young people is religion. Turkey has a history as a secular state, but religious political parties and culturally powerful groups like Gülen have grown in importance in recent decades. To learn more about religious attitudes among young adults in this rapidly changing region, we surveyed 200 students at Istanbul University. Students completed an Islamic version of the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS), along with personality measures. Using the ROS categories, 37% of students were high on both intrinsic and extrinsic subscales, 13% were extrinsic, 14% intrinsic, while 36% were low/nonreligious. This group responded 'disagree’ on average to most questions, thus rejecting statements such as Unless conditions are blocked, I fast in the month of Ramadan. In several recent western studies, possessing an analytical reasoning style was associated with atheism. We examined this using the Cognitive Reflections Test (CRT) and the Rational Experiential Inventory (REI). To obtain correct answers on the math problems of the CRT, respondents must inhibit responding with an intuitive but false answer. Correct answers on the CRT negatively correlated with ROS extrinsic orientation, r= -0.45. The REI sub-scores measuring Rational Engagement correlated with ROS extrinsic at r= -0.35, a new finding in the literature (our team previously found a trend in this direction with American college students). No relationships were found between religiousness and the broader autism phenotype (using the Autism Quotient) in contrast to several western studies. Interview data with a small number of students revealed multiple reasons for atheism and low religiousness, but a salient issue was perceived incompatibility between scientific theories (especially evolution) and religious teachings.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Michel Foucault, Religion & the Theatrical Work of Jerzy Grotowski,Catherine Christof,Loyola Marymount University,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper I will locate the work of Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski (1933 – 1999) in the context of Michel Foucault’s poststructuralist concepts, particularly those regarding the body, history and Christianity. I will investigate two plays within Grotowski’s Theatre of Productions phase to see if they indeed did manifest the boundary-defying exploration of ideological structures that Foucault’s inquiries offer to religious studies work. I will then delve more specifically into the use of what religious studies scholar Thomas Beaudoin calls a 'Foucaultian imperative’ in art, demonstrating that Grotowski’s work could be seen to manifest a new way of religious knowing through a secular realization of theatre art. I will use Foucault’s work through the traditions of religious studies scholars Jeremy Carrette and James Bernauer to challenge the place of the body in the understanding of religion. By using Foucault as an interpretive theoretical framework, religion and the body can be linked much more effectively. I will explore the impact and resonance of these ideas as they exist in the secular productions of Grotowski’s early theatre career. I will examine Grotowski’s art in light of these critiques, notably exploring Grotowski’s work in light of Carrette’s assessment of Foucault’s 'spiritual corporality.’ In so doing I will explore how the religious studies work on Foucault provides an interpretive lens through which to view these productions as a challenge to the boundaries and limits of spiritual experience. The secular form of theatre art can then be explored as a means of experiencing the sacred.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
“I Know It When I See It:” Humanism, Secularism, and Religious Taxonomy,Charles Louis Richter,George Washington University,Washington,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Few outside the academic study of religion have thought very hard about how “religion” might be defined. If pressed, they may employ the same definition that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart used when he defined “hard-core pornography” in 1964: “I know it when I see it.” The tendency toward such an intuitive definition of religion opens the door to confusion in communication—and potentially in policy. For most Americans, the terms “religion” and “church,” when used to describe broader categories, retain Christian connotations of structure, belief, and practice. These connotations are retained when they attempt to describe—in terms of religion—“secular humanism” or other quasi-religious philosophies or movements. This paper argues that secular humanism is a disruptive concept that brings to light the normative quality of religious worldviews. This paper will examine how observers who “know it when they see it” have taxonomized secular humanism and other examples of non-religion/irreligion as religions. The inclusion since the 1920s of “humanism” in catalogues of religious movements shows an evolving response to the concept that shifts with the perceived prevalence of irreligion in society, as well as the relationship between religion, irreligion, and the state. The modern case study of the Sunday Assembly, a “godless church” that started in England in 2013 and has toured North America seeding new congregations, provides a useful example of how the criteria of belief, ritual, dogma, and community are employed by both critics and supporters of the movement to evaluate its religious/ irreligious/non-religious status.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Increasing Diversity in Emerging Non-religious Communities,Christopher Hassall,University of Leeds,England,M,Ian Bushfield,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary growth in non-religious populations has given rise to novel communities with unique perspectives on social issues. We describe a study of diversity within speakers at conferences organised by and attended by the atheist community. We analyse trends in diversity of 630 speakers, corresponding to 1223 speaking slots at 48 conferences conducted for the purpose of discussing or espousing non-religious views over the period 2003–2014. Diversity among speakers (defined using multivariate statistics in terms of the representation of women and non-white people) increased significantly over time during the period studied. This broadening participation may have arisen from interventions to address issues of representation or may simply reflect a generational shift in the demographics of the community. However, on-going problems with data collection and the imbalance in the social cost of identifying as non-religious between different social groups continue to impede efforts to reduce barriers to equality within this growing movement.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.

Believing and Belonging – or not?: Trends and Predictors of Religious Belief and Belonging in the United States,Darren Sherkat,Southern Illinois University,Illinois,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the last two decades, religious scholars and pundits have increasingly argued that Europeans and Americans “believe, but don’t belong.” It is a comforting analysis for people with religious commitments, since it suggests that the rising proportion of people who don’t identify with religion, nonetheless believe in the Christian gods or the divine inspiration of Christian sacred texts. Yet, recent studies also show that belief in gods are also on the wane, and that more Americans reject the divine inspiration for Christian sacred texts. Further, many who do not believe are compelled to identify with religious groups or to participate in religious services, and this may well have been the norm in prior generations. In this paper, I use data from the 1984-2012 General Social Surveys to examine trends in believing and belonging. I focus on two measures of religious belief—non-theism and secular views of the Bible, and two measures of religious belonging—non-identification and less than yearly religious participation. I compare trends over time and across generations for (1) believing belongers; (2) believers who don’t belong; (3) non-believers who belong; and (4) people who don’t believe or belong. I estimate sets of multinomial logistic regression models to examine how patterns of belief and belonging are influences by demographic factors and childhood religious identification.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Self-Reported Reasons for Nonbelief in God’s Existence: A Quantitative Approach,David F. Bradley,Case Western University,Ohio,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research exploring why some individuals do not believe in the existence of a god or gods has largely been theory-driven, drawing from psychoanalytical, cognitive, or evolutionary theories. This has left a fundamental gap in our understanding: What reasons do nonbelievers themselves give for their nonbelief? Drawing on previous studies, this project aimed to develop and provide initial validity testing of a measure to capture these reasons: the Reasons of Atheists/Agnostics for 8 Nonbelief in God’s Existence Scale (RANGES). Participants (N = 520) were adults drawn from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk worker database. An initial item pool was developed based on a review of relevant literature and responses to open-ended questions in prior studies. The item pool was refined based on feedback from several academic researchers and non-academics who write about nonbelief. Responses to the measure were subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed a ninefactor solution: Socialization-Past, Socialization-Current, Bad Experiences with Religion, Societal Concerns, Intellectual, God Relational, Emotional, Intuitive, and Agnostic. The obtained factors were subjected to initial validity testing across a number of variables, including attitudes toward God or religion and previous measures of nonreligious identity and doubt. Correlation and multiple regression generally supported the construct validity of the measure’s subscales. Nonbelievers endorsed Intellectual reasons most strongly, followed by Agnostic, Societal Concerns, and Intuitive reasons. God Relational, Bad Experiences with Religion, Emotional, and Socialization reasons for nonbelief were endorsed less strongly. These results can help inform our understanding of the structure of nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Your Wedding, Your Way: Personalized, Non-Religious Weddings through the Universal Life Church,Dusty Hoesly,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Major national news outlets such as The New York Times have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or weddings conducted under its auspices. According to my initial research findings, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them self-describe as non-religious, usually as agnostic, atheist, apathetic, secular, or spiritual. Similarly, they describe their weddings in non-religious terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most religious language. These secular or spiritual wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. Using original survey, interview, and participant observation data, this paper explores why “secular” people employ ULC-ordained ministers for their weddings, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as religious and secular can be coconstitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheist Exceptionalism: The Definition and Legality of Atheism under the First Amendment,Ethan G. Quillen,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"For my Doctoral Thesis I employed a discursive analysis to the field of scholarly definitions of Atheism in order to alleviate the need to either define the term anew, or adopt a particular definition. This methodology granted me the freedom to see how individuals might shape their Atheist identities based upon the particular influences that have shaped the scholarly discourse on how the concept itself is defined. What this paper intends is a similar analysis, using the discursive method to interpret a judicial field in order to understand how the concept is addressed, defined, and given agency by means of legal limitations. In the 17 collection of worldwide political organizations, the United States is exceptional in the sense of its intricate legal system based upon a Constitution and its subsequent Amendments, as well as the Supreme Court’s position in overseeing and determining the legality of the citizenry’s religious actions in relation to that Constitution. As a discursive field, the decisions made by the court in regards to Atheism reveal to us an interesting perspective on how the concept is defined legally, especially in relation to its 'legality’ under the First Amendment’s two clauses concerning the disestablishment of a 'national religion’ and the free exercise granted the American citizenry. This paper will discuss this 'legality’ across three case studies—public education, oath requirements, and public displays—in order to see how certain decisions by the Court have offered both a judicial definition of Atheism, as well as where this definition places Atheism—and Atheists—within the American Civil Religion.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Looking for a 'God-Shaped Hole’: The Political Dimensions of Religiosity and Anti-Atheist Attitudes,Evan Stewart,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The current literature on negative attitudes towards atheists reports many Americans carry cultural prejudice, seeing them as immoral, cynical, and hedonistic, and that individuals with high levels of religiosity are more likely to hold these kinds of biases. That story may be too simple, though, because we do not know what kinds of religiosity are associated with these attitudes. Existing literature on the topic often mixes indicators of distinct religious constructs or narrowly chooses indicators of only one type of religiosity. Using a combination of structural equation and ordered logit modeling with 2014 survey data from The American Mosaic Project, this paper demonstrates that high religious centrality—a personal identity favoring the integration of faith with other roles in public life—is distinctly and significantly associated with both public and private distrust of atheists unlike other forms of frequent religious participation or high religious orthodoxy. This centrality also has a strong Christian component and is explicitly political. It is expressed in relationships among survey questions probing respondents’ personal religiosity and their expectation that good citizens and competent leaders will be both Christian and religious, respectively. Substantively, these results lend support for a theoretical account of citizenship which incorporates a critical approach to studying dominant cultural forms of religiosity in the United States. They also suggest that it is methodologically prudent to carefully distinguish respondents’ constructs of religiosity when attempting to explain negative attitudes towards religious and non-religious minority groups.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Nones Shall Always Be with Us: Toward an Historical Perspective on Unbelief in America,Gordon J. Melton,Baylor University,Texas,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The years of the 21st century have been marked by the heightened visibility of the American community of Unbelief (atheists, humanists, freethinkers), a growth of Christian antiatheist rhetoric led by periodic papal pronouncements, and the most recent discovery of a seemingly growing community of “nones,” people variously defined as disassociated from any religious community and/or lacking any religious preference/ identity, which has led at times to the nones being identified with the community of Unbelief in things religious or supernatural. Reflection on this state of affairs is provided by an assemblage of two sets of data. First, the historical data on religious affiliation in America through the 19th and early 20th centuries indicates that the “nones” provided a far greater percentage of the population, being the majority in the decades prior to World War II. Simultaneously, unbelief, first manifest at the end of the 18th century as deism, survived and grew through the 19th century as freethought and through the 20thcentury in a variety of movements—Ethical Culture, Marxism, atheism, and Humanism. By 1940, some 4 to 5 percent of the population identified themselves as non-theists. Projecting the historical trends into the future, the Unbelief community has grown substantially through the last half of the twentieth century to the present, though it remains as the same 4 to five percent of the population (12 to 15 million. In that time, however, it has developed more than a half-dozen national organizations, each with local communities scattered across the continent, an organized base that provides the potential of substantial growth in the next generation.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Belonging without Believing: Secular Functions of Churches in Northern Europe,Isabella Kasselstrand,Colorado Mesa University,Colorado,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Levels of religious beliefs, practices, and identification are at the center of the current debate on European secularization. Grace Davie (e.g. 1990; 2002) argues that Europeans believe without belonging, referring to high levels of individualized understandings of the supernatural, while active participation is low. In contrast, I argue that attendance alone offers a limited understanding of religious belonging, and that many Northern Europeans, particularly Scandinavians, belong without believing, in that they support and indentify with latent, secular functions of churches while they no longer believe. This study uses a mixedmethods approach comprised of in-depth interviews as well as quantitative data from the International Social Survey Program and the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey. While figures of religious belief and belonging are frequently presented in the literature, few explain and highlight such findings with qualitative data. Scotland and Sweden were chosen as two comparative case studies from the relatively secularized Northern Europe. Findings reveal that a majority of Swedes are culturally religious (e.g. Zuckerman, 2008) as they do not believe but still identify with the Church of Sweden, which serves a largely secular purpose as part of a cultural heritage and as a provider of life cycle ceremonies. In Scotland, on the other hand, belonging without believing is more closely associated with a sense of community or cultural defense (e.g. Bruce, 2002) in a nation that is more religiously diverse. The findings ultimately draw attention to the importance of context and conceptualization in the study of distinct and multidimensional processes of secularization.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheist Churches: All of the Community with “None” of the Theology,Jacqui Frost,University of Minnesota,Minnesota,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Many have shown that religious involvement is one of the most common gateways into other forms of civic and community involvement in America, with the church being both a physical and ideological anchor around which community and morality are built. As younger cohorts are associating with organized religion less and less, many fear that America is in a “crisis of community” in which an increase in individualism and a decrease in religious affiliation has led to a decline in group membership and social networks, which in turn has led to a decline in reciprocity and trust amongst Americans. However, instead of retreating from community involvement, a large portion of these “nones” are instead forming their own voluntary associations, even churches, in response to a lack of secular outlets for community and civic engagement. This research is an ethnographic exploration of one of these communities - The Sunday Assembly. Founded in 2013 and dubbed an “atheist church” by the media, this group expects to have 100 “assemblies” worldwide by the end of 2014. Through in-depth interviews with organizers and members of one smaller, local group, as well as participant observation at their gatherings, I explore how this group is both copying and re-molding the church model in order to build a secular community around bettering themselves and their communities without invoking religious ideologies, in many ways complicating the crisis of community thesis. I will detail key findings from the first eight months of observations and interviews, fleshing out how one assembly is navigating their way through the logistics of becoming an organization while simultaneously fostering an emotionally and socially engaged community.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Politics of Secularism and the Paradox of a ChristianAmerican Ethos,Jeffrey Murico,San Diego State University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper analyzes the presence of secularization debates in the political arena in order to reveal a prevalent paradoxical Christian-American ethos. In short, this paper argues that those who are concerned with the encroachment of “secularism” are themselves secularizing various aspects of “religion” when engaging in the political process. Citing multiple examples, but focusing on one case study in more depth – the Mount Soledad Cross controversy - this paper argues that in each of these cases, those who seek to defend “the religious” from the threat of “secularism” are ultimately the ones doing the secularizing. Since 1913, some form of a cross has stood in the center of a public city park atop Mount Soledad in San Diego, California despite efforts by separationists to remove it who claim that its existence and maintenance is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Defenders of the cross argue that its existence on public land is Constitutional because the cross is not a religious symbol. Rather, they argue that the cross should be understood as a secular symbol – one that represents American identity, patriotism, and military service. This particular approach, I argue, is representative of a wider, paradoxical Christian-American ethos where “defenders of Christianity” resort to secularizing “the religious” as an attempt to preserve what they hold to be sacred. In order to preserve the cross in its current location, appellants are arguing that the cross has been divested of its religious meaning. In the end, such tactics contribute to, rather than defend against, the secularization process.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Transformations of Self and Society in Modern Egypt,Jeffrey T. Kenney,DePauw University,Indiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to measures such as the World Values Survey, Muslim-majority nations like Egypt constitute the most religious, and thus the least secularized, regions of the globe. Voices of atheism can be heard in Egypt, and they are becoming more forceful, but they are rare and draw attention more for their novelty than their social and political significance. Indeed, rational discussions about secularism/secularization in Egypt have been made difficult by an array of factors: the legacy of Western colonialism, authoritarian politics, a forceful Islamist opposition, and ongoing cultural debates about modern identity and authenticity. But signs of liberalism are evident in the emerging consumer culture. Egyptians are coming to see themselves, and express their identities, like many others around the world: in terms of class and the power to consume. And this trend has opened up the possibility for what one author has termed “cultural extroversion”—the capacity of Muslims to interpret lifestyle choice as coincident with religion. My presentation will explore the growing trend in self-help and personal development literature in Egypt, situating it within the demands of global capitalism and the psychological values of the enterprising self. Self-help, whether in Egypt or the US, legitimizes a turn inward, to explore and nurture the true self—a self often portrayed as hidden or suppressed by the dictates of traditional mores. The result of such self-exploration is not a rejection of Islam as much as it is its transvaluation: envisioning Muhammad as the Muslim Dale Carnegie or Allah as life coach. Through an analysis of selfhelp literature, I will analyze how the inroad of capitalism in Egypt is reshaping notions of the self, away from traditional Islamic notions to a self more in line with global capitalist culture.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

Sociologists from Max Weber and Emile Durkheim to modern theorists such as Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson have argued that as societies modernize there is a dramatic decline in religious adherence, authority, and influence. Alternative models, which stress the centrality of free-markets and the inverse correlation between existential security and religiosity, are posited to explain the exceptional position of modern societies that remain highly religious. The pages that follow apply the theories above in order to elucidate the process of secularization in the Iranian context. Two questions are germane to this task: 1.)

Religious Nones in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Similar to many other modern Western nations, religious nones are growing rapidly in Canada. Religious nones represent onequarter of Canadian adults and one-third of Canadian teens today yet little is known empirically about this group in the Canadian context. Drawing on thirty interviews with religious nones, this paper explores some of the perceived benefits for identifying as a religious none, their beliefs about the supernatural, about meaning and purpose in life as well as the afterlife, about morality, and their aversion to religion that is forced on to others. Amidst their varied views on the supernatural and the afterlife, overall most religious nones believe that they are free and openminded relative to those who are deeply religious, they believe that they have meaning and purpose in life, they reject the assertion that humans need religion to be moral, and they adamantly oppose those who force their religion on to others – and this includes religious nones who do not believe that they ought to convince others to also become religious nones. In total these findings resonate with a pervasive and growing Canadian secular ethos that rejects exclusive belief systems, prides itself on the stance that religion is an individual and private matter, and opposes forcing one’s beliefs on to another – all in the name of protecting cultural ideals of diversity, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Polysecularity and Types of Nonbelief: Framing the Field of Secular Studies,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The affirmative commitments of nonreligious people leave them generally uninterested in personal religiosity, and keep them at relative distance apart from organized religions. This nonreligiosity is poorly characterized in terms of some “religious deficit” model, as if nonreligiosity should be framed by cognitive/ affective disabilities to be religious (e.g. a deficit in mentalization or theory of mind). Nor should nonreligiosity be framed in terms of any “religious aversion” model, supposing that the nonreligious person suffers from compulsive aversions to religion’s communal, compliance, or character demands. The establishment and development of Secular Studies has been obstructed by theological stereotypes for the nonreligious: the 'secular’ involves insensitivity or impassivity to religious wonders, or secularity is the realm of rudely materialistic and utilitarian matters, or secularity may be a manifestation of 'anti-religious’ antagonisms. Fair research into the thoughts and motives of nonreligious people should instead begin with them in their own lived worlds, not just contrasted against idealized theological portraits of religious people in theirs. Secularity should no longer be conceptualized solely in terms of regrettable deviations from hegemonic theological norms. The enjoyment of rewarding worldly pursuits, the concern for sound social relationships, and the engagement with important civic issues are prominent modes of functional secular living displayed across historical time periods and civilizations. I have labeled this broadly historical and global phenomenon as 'polysecularity’, suitable for multidisciplinary investigation. The world’s highways are not all roads going away from Rome; worldly pursuits are not all flights heading away from religion.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Religious Actions Speak Louder than Words: Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs) Predicts Theism and Non-theism,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,Michael Buhrmester,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A central claim of the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that pan-human cognitive mechanisms explain supernatural agent beliefs. This claim faces the challenge of accounting for nontheism. More precisely, if nearly all human beings possess the cognitive mechanisms outlined by CSR scholars, then how do we explain patterns in the presence of theists and non-theists? Evolutionary anthropologist Joseph Henrich has proposed the existence of a psychological bias focused on “Credibility Enhancing Displays” (CREDs). We are biased, Henrich argues, to believe the representations we receive from others to the extent that they 'walk the walk’ and not just 'talk the talk’. The implication for theism and non-theism is that individuals will be much less likely to acquire the theistic beliefs of their communities if they are not exposed to sufficient levels of CREDs. We will present new evidence from a diverse sample of Americans suggesting that CREDs exposure, as measured by our recently validated scale (alpha= .92), predicts theism vs. non-theism (B= .519, p< .01), all while controlling for religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for theism. They suggest that actions do indeed speak louder than words in convincing individuals of the reality of supernatural agents and that, to be successfully transmitted, religious commitments must be embodied.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Navigating the Nonbeliever Constellation: What’s at Stake in Labeling Nonbelievers and Secular Activists?,Joseph Blankholm,Columbia University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent articles from J.M. Smith (2011, 2013), LeDrew (2013), Cimino and Smith (2007, 2011, 2012), and Guenther et al. (2013) point both directly and indirectly to the need for a dialogue on how to describe America’s “nonbelievers.” Cragun and Hammer (2011) have provided sage advice for avoiding tacit pro-religiosity, though much discussion remains. Namely, should scholars treat humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, naturalists, and non-theists as a single group, and how carefully should they attend to the particularities ascribed to these terms by those who adopt them? This paper relies on 65 in-depth interviews with the leaders and members of America’s major nonbeliever organizations in order to provide concrete examples of how leaders from various types of groups understand their own labels and those of others. Because there is no consensus among these leaders, I couch my analysis within their interorganizational politics, and I observe the ways in which they both emphasize and minimize differences among the terms depending on the context. I then look at how scholars in our burgeoning field have chosen to describe these various groups, with the aim of offering some tentative suggestions on how to attend to the differences between them while still making use of efficacious umbrella categories. My hope is to spur a dialogue among those in attendance that I believe would be as helpful for others’ research and writing as I am certain it would be for my own.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

If Given Clear Evidence for the Existence of a God, How Do Atheists and Agnostics Think They Would Respond?,Julie J. Exline,Case Western University,Ohio,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How do atheists and agnostics imagine that they would respond in two hypothetical situations: 1) being presented with clear evidence that a god actually did exist and 2) encountering this god, with a choice to approach, stand still, or move away? Adult participants (N = 520) from the U.S. completed an online survey via Amazon’s MTurk. Only those who endorsed nonbelief in any god on a screening question completed the survey. Results suggested that nonbelievers varied considerably in their imagined responses to god-focused evidence and encounters. On Likert items (consolidated through factor analysis), confusion was endorsed most, then fear, a loss of freedom, and positive emotion (these three did not differ), then anger, then guilt/ shame. An open-ended item revealed responses not tapped in the Likert items, including shock/surprise, continued skepticism, curiosity, awe, and decisions about whether to follow the god and whether/how to change one’s life and beliefs. In terms of the imagined encounter, most participants reported preferences to approach or stand still vs. moving away. In comparison to agnostics, atheists (especially “closed” atheists) imagined more negatively valenced responses (e.g., more anger, more loss of freedom, less positive emotion, less approach behavior, and more avoidance). In general, more positively valenced emotions and behaviors were associated with greater age, higher agreeableness and conscientiousness, lower neuroticism, more positive ratings of the (hypothetical) god’s attributes, more struggles involving religious doubts, less certainty about one’s nonbelief, fewer interpersonal struggles around religion, and fewer microaggressions related to one’s nonbelief.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular Students and Spirituality,Kathleen M. Goodman,Miami University,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within higher education and student affairs, it has become very common to provide programming related to “spirituality” of college students, based on the premise that everyone is spiritual. Using data from a national study of college student spirituality conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute, I will investigate to the extent to which the concepts of spirituality as defined in the study are applicable to secular students in the sample. The original study, conducted from 2003-2007 used principle components analysis to identify factors related to spirituality, religion, and related qualities (which they defined as charitable involvement, ethical involvement, etc.). A major conclusion from the study was that today’s college students have very high levels of spiritual interest and involvement. My study seeks to understand whether that holds true for secular students. Preliminary findings suggest that secular students score lower than the overall sample on measures of spirituality and religion, but they score only slightly lower on the related qualities measures. I conclude that many of the topics called “spirituality” are salient for secular students, however, the concept is not universally applicable. A practical implication based on these findings is that educators should begin with the broad concept of “Pathways to Purpose,” or “Purpose, Meaning, and Values” (rather than defining that as spirituality) to create a more inclusive environment. Framing programming in this way will broaden conversations so students can position themselves in the conversation in ways that are authentic to them, whether they are spiritual, religious, secular, or some combination.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Nonreligion and Religious Pluralism in Australia: A New Context for Christian Identity and Dialogue,Kevin Lenehan,Catholic Theological College,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"By all indicators, Australia is among the most nonreligious nations on earth, rated 10th by the WIN-Gallup 2012 Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. In this paper I will firstly outline religious/nonreligious identification in Australia on the basis of the 2011 national census data. A comparison with earlier data shows a steady decrease in identification with Christian churches other than Roman Catholicism, a small but steady increase in identification with religions other than Christianity, and a consistent increase in the number of Australians identifying as 'no religion’ (22.5% in 2011). In the second section of the paper, I will look beyond the statistics of institutional identification to explore social research into the beliefs and practices Australians use to make sense of life. This perspective calls for a more nuanced description of religious/nonreligious identity than data such as a national census can provide. In the Australian context, as well as intentional religious and nonreligious identification we find evidence of high levels of both 'believing without belonging’ and 'belonging without believing’, within a pragmatic cultural attitude of 'practical secularity’. This situation is reminiscent of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s analysis of his own 1940s European context, a 15 post-Christendom culture in which people lived and acted 'as though God does not exist’. In the third section of the paper, I will draw on Bonhoeffer’s challenging insights about what the Christian church can learn from the 'promising godlessness’ of its contemporaries to propose some characteristics of the kind of dialogue Christians are called to in Australia’s pluralistic context.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
How Christian Atheists Can Shed Light on Anti-Atheist Prejudice in America,Kyle Thompson,Claremont Graduate University,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Anti-atheist prejudice in the United States is well documented in both academic studies and in news media yet its underlying causes are still not fully known. Since data suggests that atheists experience prejudice in different ways and for different reasons than other more prominent types of discrimination, such as racial prejudice, the process of understanding anti-atheist prejudice likely requires unique research and critical thinking. In this essay, I will explore possible explanations for anti-atheist prejudice based on the most comprehensive scientific examinations of atheists as well as propose that social scientists study Christian atheists, people who lack a belief in God but subscribe to the moral teachings of Jesus, to see if they experience the same degree of prejudice and stereotyping as other atheists. While sociological data indicates that much of the negative stereotyping surrounding atheism results from concerns about an atheist’s ability to behave morally, it is not clear precisely what causes this moral distrust since atheists tend to not only lack a belief in any supernatural moral scorekeeper, but also any universal and codified set of ethical norms such as those found in religious texts. Since Christian atheists affirm the set of ethical norms of Christianity while lacking a belief in God, it would be highly useful to investigate whether people hold the same stereotypical view of them as they do atheists who do not self-identity as Christian atheists.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Religious Markets, Regimes, and Secularity: A Comparative Study,Linda Lockett,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,F,Ted G. Jelen,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, we present three models of religion/regime relations. The “Quasi-Establishment” model describes nations with pluralistic religious markets, in which explicitly religious alternatives seek social and political advantages. Nations which embody the ancien regime model have a dominant religious tradition, which has been discredited through association with a previously undemocratic regime. Finally, National Identity regimes consist of nations in which a particular religious affiliation is a component of national identity, and in which this link has been defined by the actions of an outside power. We hypothesize that the correlations of religious non-affiliation will be different in each regime type. In religiously pluralistic societies, non-affiliation will largely be caused by individual characteristics, such as education and education. In nations that embody the ancient regime model, religious non-affiliation will be positively related to indicators of secular social integration, such as participation in voluntary associations, partisan identification, etc. Conversely, religious non-affiliation will be negatively related to social integration in national identity regimes. Data for this study will be taken from the World Values Surveys, with two cases for each regime type. We will consider India and Brazil to be examples of the Quasiestablishment model, Chile and Turkey as instances of the ancient regime model, and Poland and Iran as national identity exemplars.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular or Nonreligious? Profiling and Theorising European and US 'Religious Landscapes’,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In profiling religiosity, Europe and the US are almost always described as different: 'secular Europe’ and 'religious America’. This paper presents quantitative data that show that the secular population (i.e. the number of people who are more or less indifferent to religion) is consistent not only across European countries but is also of a similar scale in Europe and the US. On the other hand, the size of the active nonreligious population varies, between these countries and continents. Thus, secularity appears to be less significant for understanding differences between the European and US 'religious landscapes’ than active participation in religious and nonreligious cultures: several European countries appear to have vital nonreligious cultures with established histories, whilst this is an emerging phenomenon in the US. I argue therefore that the study of nonreligion as distinct from secularity is fundamental to progressing understanding of contemporary societies and theorising their causes and development.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
In the Name of a Draconian Conception of State Neutrality’: Law’s Affirmation that You Can’t be Good without God,Lori Beaman,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The legal regulation of religion extends beyond categories of religion to the emerging category of nones. Most famously, the Lautsi decision in Italy highlighted the tensions that emerge between historically dominant religious hegemonies and those whose lives are not informed by religious worldviews. And yet, the European Court of Human Rights entertained the notion that dominant religion is not necessarily religion per se, but represents universal and cultural values which inform and indeed benefit all of society. Contrary to the argument of atheists that one can be good without god, legal discourse is shaping a new rhetoric of the foundational nature of religion to the common good, an idea that presses even those who do not 'believe’ to believe, or to at least accept the inherent value of god in the creation of a good society. The universal truth of religion becomes, then, inescapable and impossible to opt out of. This new legal rhetoric has increasing traction in a number of western democracies whose majoritarian religion would seem to be in decline. Law is coming to the rescue, carving out a new place for religion as fundamental to societal well-being and religious practices and symbols in state institutions are therefore an acceptable and even welcome presence. This talk will explore these issues in light of the Saguenay case that is now before the Supreme Court of Canada.",2014,Annual lecture/Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
What Happens in Vegas is... Moral Embattlement: Irreligious Moral Performance as Cultural Resistance in Sin City,Lori L. Fazzino,University of Nevada,Nevada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Labeling atheists as immoral individuals, the very personification of evil, is not a particularly new idea. Attaining civic inclusion in a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, a city like Las Vegas where God is believed to be absent, would be easy. This is simply not the case. The strong cultural lore of “Sin City” promotes a false illusion that Las Vegas is a city where vice trumps virtue for sinners rather than saints. In this paper, I take a qualitative ethnographic approach that integrates participant observation, visual data, and in-depth interviews with textual analysis of local news stories. My goal is to understand how atheists have engaged in community building, activism, and collective boundary work in Las Vegas. My findings suggest that the moral landscape of Las Vegas very much a terrain of resistance where the interplay between religious and secular ideologies create a contested web of power and counter-power relations, indicating that even in Las Vegas where it is acceptable to be a sinner, heathens are persona non grata. I argue that the mobilization of collective action among the Las Vegas humanists and atheists community should be understood as dramaturgical performances of irreligious morality that both justifies the rejection of deviant labels and challenges the moral proclivity of American theists. The implications of these findings center on larger issues concerning atheist visibility, which I contend is a cultural expression of resistance, not only in “Sin City”, but in the United States as a whole",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Ninety-Eight Atheists: Atheism among the Non-Elite in Twentieth Century Britain,Matt Sheard,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Widespread atheism in the general population is one of the defining characteristics of twentieth-century British society, yet until very recently, it has largely been unregarded by historians. This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced 'irreligious socialisation’, rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12–18% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as 'unarticulated causes’ of the subjects’ irreligion.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.,.
The Rise of the Nones: Politics, Spirituality, and Neo-Secularization,Matthew Brake,George Mason University,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The United States has traditionally been a “churched” nation and has often been cited by desecularization theorists as an indicator of the flawed nature of the secularization thesis; however, in the past decade, the U.S. has seen a rise of those identifying themselves as having no religious affiliation. These so-called religious “nones” have caused some debate about the future of religion in the U.S. Are there any societal reasons for this increase? Does the rise of the religious nones indicate a decline of religious belief in the United States? Does this trend give validity to the secularization thesis? In this paper, I will first evaluate the reasons for the rise of the religious nones in light of considerations from José Casanova’s article, “Rethinking Secularization: A Global Comparative Perspective.” In dialogue with Casanova, I will compare the relationship between state/ church politics and the secularization of Europe with the relationship between state/politics politics and the rise of the nones in the United States. Next, I will consider the religious make-up of the religious nones with particular attention paid to the presence of any private spirituality among this group. Appropriating the work of Rodney Stark, I will consider whether the persistence of spirituality among the nones constitutes an effective rebuttal of the secularization thesis. Finally, I will consider the work of Mark Chaves and consider whether or not neo-secularization is an adequate concept for understanding the phenomenon of the religious nones in the United States.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Secular Cooperation in England and the Americas,Michael Rectenwald,New York University,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, I treat Secularism as founded by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851-52. In particular, I focus on the distinction that Holyoake maintained over the course of fifty years regarding his branch of Secularism, in the face of the broader, arguably more successful division of the movement led by Charles Bradlaugh. As distinct from Bradlaugh, for Holyoake the “secular” did not primarily signify the absence or negation of religious belief or practice. Rather, by the secular, Holyoake indicated a substantive category in its own right. Secularism itself represented a “positive” creed and movement intended to supersede or superintend both theism and atheism. Holyoake imagined and fostered the co-existence of secular and religious elements subsisting under a common umbrella. The secular and religious were figured as complementary and co-constituting aspects of what we might call, after Charles Taylor, an overarching “secularity,” but which Holyoake termed Secularism proper. Holyoake’s Secularism was not only at odds with the understanding of the Bradlaugh camp during his own lifetime but also it differs markedly from the standard secularization thesis as developed from the nineteenth century and beyond. This paper examines the movement that united atheists, skeptics, “agnostics,” and liberal theists, who might cooperate for the material improvement of humanity, especially the working classes, using Secularism as their creed. It particularly emphasizes Holyoake’s insistence on the cooperation among believers and unbelievers. It traces the movement to the Americas and examines the varieties of Secularism that came under Holyoake’s influence, or resisted it.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
On the Origin and Rise of Atheism,Mikko Sillfors,University of Helsinki,Finland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Theism has probably been the most influential belief in human history. However, atheism/naturalism can be traced back to ancient schools like Epicureanism and Cˉarvˉaka (India) and during the last 300 years atheism has gradually become fairly general in some countries. What is the origin of atheism? Why is it increasing? Based on dual-process theory and recent research on atheism a theoretical 'holistic’ hypothesis can be made. According to dual-process theory processes of human mind can be divided into intuitive (automatic, rapid, nonverbal, evolutionary old) and reflective (controlled, slow, linked to language, evolutionary recent). In holistic hypothesis three levels of factors are taken into account in explaining atheism/theism. 1) Biological level. Especially two universally evolved intuitive human cognitive traits — hyperactive agency detection device (HADD) and theory of mind (ToM) — have helped mankind to survive but have also made theism attractive. This partially explains why gods and supernatural beliefs have dominated the human history. 2) Psychological level. Those who are more prone to reflective processing or have deficiency of ToM seem to have a tendency towards atheism. This in part explains why scepticism/atheism is an ancient and universal phenomenon. 3) Sociocultural level. Certain (mostly modern) factors – like general wealth, security, modern environment, freedom of belief, education, secularization, and public visibility of atheism and natural/scientific explanations – seem to decline people’s motivation for religion and/or incline minds into reflective processing. From the viewpoint of holistic hypothesis, both theism and atheism are 'natural’ stances.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
The Collective Consciousness of Atheism,Mohammad Abdel Haq,"California State University, Fullerton",California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite a doctrine of separation of church and state, religion continues to play a significant role in American politics. Churches facilitate political participation through shared interests, resources, and motivation and religion plays a substantial role in shaping morality, as well as political views and attitudes. Weber argues that the “Protestant Ethic” dominates what is normative in the social and political sphere in the United States. In this study, we examine whether religion is in fact necessary for the creation of a collective moral and political framework or whether secular individuals such as atheists are also capable of sharing a collective consciousness. We do so by asking two questions; first, does a collective political framework exist among atheists? Second, if so, how do the political attitudes of atheists differ from the Protestant majority in regards to party affiliation? We explore these questions using a multinomial logistic regression approach, utilizing data from the 2008 Pew Research Center’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, a nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults. Our results suggest that atheists are very different demographically from Protestants in terms of region, gender, education level, and generation. However, after controlling for these differences, there are still substantial differences in political views and moral attitudes between Protestants and Atheists. We argue that these differences represent differing sets of shared beliefs and moral attitudes, or collective consciousness, between Protestants and Atheist, and are not simply the result of differences in other characteristics.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Irreligious Death: Making Meaning without the Theist Crutch,Nicholas J. MacMurray,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas",Nevada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Death is a universal experience, but the meanings and practices surrounding death vary according to cultural and temporal contexts. Examining how different groups approach end of life preparations, death practices, and grief management provides valuable insight into the varied meanings of death and the broader sociocultural context in which they exist. In the United States, death is often understood in the context of religion. As such, secular death practices and grief management is grossly understudied. This ethnographic study is an attempt to understand how individuals with an irreligious worldview handle the management of death within a hegemonic religious context where much of the language and practice surrounding death holds little meaning, and consequently, little value. Because irreligious individuals lack the social crutches provided by religion, they must find other means for confronting death and managing grief. Utilizing a “death acceptance” framework, we identity the unique challenges irreligious individuals face when reconciling the “death of self” and dealing with the “death of other” and outline various irreligious death practices and grief management strategies. We argue that the lack of institutionalized secular death culture increases the difficulty of managing death and grief, but ultimately reinforces an irreligious death acceptance perspective. By focusing inquiry on irreligious understandings, negotiations, and practices surrounding death and the ways in which these contrast with normative social practices at large, this study highlights the need for establishing a more inclusive death culture and contributes to the scholarship on the lived experience of irreligion in the United States today.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Atheists Still Others?

Michele Lamont has argued that moral worthiness is an important form of social capital in the United States, and religiosity has served as a kind of proxy for this social capital in both private and public life (e.g. for being a good neighbor, or a good citizen). Religion serves as a basis for cultural membership in American life, and a stated rejection of religion (e.g. the affirmation of an atheist identity) serves to define and sharpen a key symbolic boundary that separates authentic/good/true citizens from inauthentic/ problematic ones. In the spring of 2014, a 10-year follow-up survey was fielded by the Boundaries in the American Mosaic project team. In this paper, I compare the findings on religious outsiders in 2014 with those from 2003. Attitudes towards atheists have not changed appreciably in that ten-year time frame, despite the rising percentage and visibility of those claiming no religious identity (the “nones”). In this analysis, I first compare the determinants of atheist distrust in 2003 and 2014 with a special focus on the intersection of age and religiosity. Second, I compare the determinants of atheist distrust with those factors predicting distrust of other small religious out-groups (Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons).

The Pope and the “Nones”: Pope Francis and the New Age of Atheism,Peter F. Huff,Centenary College of Louisiana,Louisiana,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The Catholic church’s Second Vatican Council (1962-65) identified atheism as “one of the most serious problems of our time.” The council’s landmark document, The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, called for “sincere and prudent” dialogue with unbelievers in the age of secularism. Pope Paul VI (1963-78) endorsed dialogue with atheists in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam and established an unprecedented Vatican department to oversee the dialogue: the Secretariat for Non-Believers. He also commissioned the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to make the study of atheism a priority for the priestly order’s intellectual apostolate. A half century after the council, however, Catholic-atheist dialogue remains part of Vatican II’s unfinished agenda. The 2013 papal election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio has sparked new interest in dialogue between believers and unbelievers. A “Francis Effect” has been observed in various areas of ecclesial and social life—from curial reform in the Vatican to public discourse on social justice and gay marriage. This paper investigates the impact of Pope Francis on the relationship of the church to non-believers, especially the “nones” rapidly reshaping contemporary religious experience. The paper traces the development of Francis’ understanding of the phenomenon of modern unbelief from his writings as Jesuit educator and Archbishop of Buenos Aires to his principal papal messages: his encyclical Lumen Fidei, his apostolic letter Evangelii Gaudium, his 2014 World Day of Peace message, and his controversial interviews in La Repubblica and La Civiltà Cattolica. The paper seeks to advance the argument: As the church’s first Jesuit and American pope, Francis brings to his office fresh resources and unexpected perspectives that promise to fulfill Vatican II’s dream of “sincere and prudent” dialogue with the secular world.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

A theme that emerged during the study was the difficulty that participants had finding compatible partners for romantic relationships. This study proposes to explore this issue in more depth. Slowly but surely a body of scientific knowledge is being built about people who are not affiliated with organized religion. However, there is still little empirical research addressing the day-to-day lived experiences of religious nones and what impact, if any, their lack of religious affiliation has on their lives. There are a couple of articles that address nones and parenting. However, no research was found that directly addresses how nones experience dating, relationships and marriage, and how these impact their well-being. This study surveys nones online to gather data about their romantic relationships. This availability sample collects, in addition to demographics, information on how nones find romantic partners, the demographics of whom nones get involved with romantically, and the quality and duration of relationships. The impact on well-being of not being affiliated with a religion on romantic relationships will also be presented, using both quantitative and qualitative data. This study will add to the knowledge base about the nature of day-to-day lives of nones, as well as, contribute a better understanding of the social and psychological well-being of nones.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
“Splitters!”: Lessons from Monty Python for Nontheist/ Freethought Organizations in the US,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the 19th century saw a wave of popularity for freethinkers in the US, much of this excitement had died down by the early part of the 20th century. Just a handful of nontheist and freethought organizations remained, and most of them were very small and on the verge of collapsing. However, starting in 1941 with the founding of the American Humanist Association and followed by the founding of American Atheists in 1963, the number of nontheist organizations experienced a slow increase. Today, there are several large, national, member-based nontheist/freethought social movement organizations in the US and thousands of smaller, local organizations. In this paper we examine the origins and inter-relations of four of the largest nontheist/freethought organizations in the US: the American Humanist Association, American Atheists, the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. In examining the origins of these organizations, we draw upon several social movement theories but also extend current theorizing by discussing the importance of inter-personal relationships for understanding how social movement organizations “split” or “fracture”. We also discuss whether these “splits” facilitate or hinder the aims of the broader movement in the US.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.
Universalized – Classical- Secularization Theory,Volkan Ertit,Radbound University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The classical theory of secularization remains one of the most controversial in the field of social science. According to the theory, modernization is the main reason behind the aggressive secularization process now pervading Europe. There are two main issues of discussion among respected sociologists and theologists in this regard. First, there is an ongoing debate on the meaning of the theory, especially among American and European scholars, in which they have yet to find consensus regarding the answers to the questions, “what does the theory assert?” and “what does it not assert?” The second discussion, which cannot be considered separately from the first one, is whether the theory is able to put forward a clear explanation for the bumpy relationship between religion and society in the European context and other parts of the world. In my paper, I will attempt to provide some answers to the two questions mentioned above. Firstly, I will try to shed some light on what the classical secularization theory asserts and does not assert. Then, in a clear departure from more well-known theorists like Steve Bruce and Bryan Wilson, I will argue that the theory is not only valid for European societies but for every society at large. To make the theory universal in its relevance, the old classical secularization paradigm needs to be slightly revised. In attempting this, aspects of the old paradigm that belong to the history of Europe and its offshoots (Protestan Reformation) will be somewhat downplayed while those with more universal relevance (scientific advances, urbanization and industrial capitalism) will be highlighted.",2014,Conference,Explaining Nonreligion and Secularity in the U.S. and Beyond,.,.,.

Thompson argues that this shift in atheist discourse is one researchers of nonreligion should take note of.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In the end, Harris’ latest work explores new ground, but isn’t earthshattering. It brings attention to the potential benefits of secular spiritual practices, demonstrating with (generally) crystal-clear prose that jettisoning religious dogma does not require one to dismiss a contemplative life that benefits from increased awareness of the present moment. True, Harris’ philosophical conclusions regarding meditation are dubious at times, and his advice to spiritual neophytes is disappointing, but that doesn’t diminish the effectiveness of this work to serve as a clear wake up call to the secular world. It’s time more secularists realized that the religious do not have a monopoly on spirituality; there’s no reason why the secular world can’t access it too."
Celebrating Christmas without religion: Katherine Sissons looks back at the festive season,Katherine Sissons,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Before the new year dust settles and we leave January, Katherine Sissons takes a look back at Christmas. In this article, she considers the question: ‘What do atheists do at Christmas?’ Drawing on interviews with her London based atheist participants, Katherine argues that their Christmases are far from meaningless without the ‘Christ’, showing instead that they are linked with family relationships and a sense of personal identity.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Writing in 1971, Colin Campbell noted that the nonreligious were often depicted as ‘loners’. (Campbell 2013). Interviewing nonreligious people for this article, it was clear to me that, although they celebrate Christmas in different ways, they all plan their celebrations with reference to a web of social relations. They consider, accommodate, and negotiate the expectations of family, friends, colleagues, and wider society. Sonia delayed her decision to stop giving Christmas presents because she was nervous about the impact that decision would have on her social life – her ties to her family and to her nephew in particular. Kathleen’s enthusiasm about her Christmas tree is not a symptom of individualism or materialism, and does not contradict her statement that ‘Christmas is about family’. When she speaks of ‘connections to the past’ and ‘lots of lost memories’, it is clear that the lost decorations were important to her because they represented some of her most significant social relationships – to her mother, grandmother and daughter. Theorists across a range of disciplines have acknowledged that social identity is multifaceted: gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, religion are just some elements that might comprise one person’s identity. Social identity is also situational – as an individual moves between social settings, different aspects of their identity may feel more important than others. Perhaps some people expect the Christmas activities of the nonreligious to differ radically from those of Christians. In doing so, they assume that a person’s position with regard to religion should override other aspects of their identity in determining their Christmas practices. In fact, other aspects of identity also influence the ways in which nonreligious people celebrate. Sonia’s family acknowledge their genealogical and cultural ties to the Caribbean with the food that they eat. Rita described her Latvian celebrations with great enthusiasm, but only talked about her lack of religious belief when prompted. Perhaps for Rita, her Latvian heritage is more salient than her ‘atheism-slash-humanism’ at Christmas time."
Discourse Analysis and the Study of Atheism: Definitions, Discourse, and Ethnographic Criticism,Ethan G. Quillen,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Ethan Quillen explores a discursive approach to atheism (and nonreligion) following the theoretical work of von Stuckrad (2003). Quillen suggests that researchers in this area move away from definitions and wrangling over the the meaning of words, and concentrate instead on the way in which these words are used; how these words are made meaningful and allowing research participants to ‘speak for themselves’. Here, Quillen proposes that this discursive approach has methodological implications for research in this field.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"During this methodological review I came across von Stuckrad’s (2003, 2010, 2013) discussion of the benefits of a ‘discourse analysis’ in the study of religion, and many of the issues addressed in his work seemed aptly comparable to my own. That is, given the predicament of defining religion, his discursive approach seemed to obviate the ‘need’ to define terminology at all, favoring instead an analysis of the process with which individuals use terms like ‘religion’—or ‘Atheism’—in the development of identity construction. In essence, a discursive analysis is an examination of the way in which a particular use of language is generated, employed, and observed. In this way, the term ‘Atheism’ can be approached the same way as the term ‘religion,’ an ‘empty signifier’ (von Stuckrad 2003: 166) that is then filled with meaning depending on the language used. No longer does this require a ‘definition.’ Now, we can perceive how ‘language in use’ (van Dijk 1997; Fairclough 2003; Gee 2005; Paltridge 2006) provides meaning to the term within particular contexts. In many ways, this discursive approach seems quasi-anthropological in its allowing one’s informants to ‘speak for themselves.’ For my intentions, ‘using’ Atheism in this way, worked quite nicely. From this analysis I was able to create a processual understanding, a foundational interpretation less like a definition, and more an appreciation, about how the Atheists within my data discursively use the term in relation to the scholarly discourse defining it. This methodology, in different ways, has allotted me the freedom from constructing yet another definition, and subsequently both removed my analysis from the ambiguous nature inherent in defining the term, as well as reinforced the ethnographic nature of my intentions. More specifically, though, it has permitted the opportunity to perceive Atheism as a visible or ‘expressed’ identity (von Stuckrad 2003: 263) that, in the coming years, I hope to further explore through data such as fiction, film, art, court decisions, and within immeasurable other discursive fields."
Reflections from the Field: Deconversion, Irreligion and Practical Nonreligion The Case of Leaving Ultra Orthodox Judaism,Louis Frankenthaler,Ben Gurion University,Israel,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Louis Frankenthaler draws on his research with Ultra Orthodox Jewish communities to explore narratives of leaving religion, which he describes as rich in moral and social dilemmas. He also discusses the extent to which deconversion may be understood as an expression of ‘irreligion’.",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"This blog post is a reflection of part of my ongoing research on deconversion, or the loss of faith (Barbour 1994), in the Ultra Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish community. I point to parallels between examples of deconversion explored in my work and Colin Campbell’s (1971/2013) concept of ‘irreligion’. That is to say, Haredi deconversion is an expression of irreligion, the active rejection of an available religion or ‘beliefs and actions which are expressive of attitudes of hostility or indifference toward the prevailing religion, together with… the rejection of its demands’ (Campbell 2013/1971). Furthermore, religious rejection is an element of the deconversion typology which certainly reflects the way people position themselves in opposition (or difference) to their abandoned religion. Irreligion is a formative idea in nonreligion studies and scholars have moved beyond and expanded upon it, pointing out some of its negative associations (Lee 2012). "

The Victorian period saw secularism and atheism transformed from individual eccentricities to social movements.   Two long-standing secularist institutions formed during this period:  the National Secular Society, and the Rationalist Press Association.  The Victorians also witnessed the gradual transformation of a liberal Christian congregation, meeting at South Place Chapel, into the Ethical Union.  The stories of the Rationalist Association, the National Secular Society, and the Ethical Union (which eventually became the British Humanist Association) continue to intertwine, and the organisations continue to make history."
What Religion is your Baby?,Katherine Sissons,University of Oxford,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post Katherine Sissons reflects on the Census 2011. She discusses the statistically significant relationship between gender and reliosity in female and male babies and young children (aged 0-4). What impact might this have for understanding the ‘nones’ and the way that the gender balance of adult religiosity and non-religiosity has on the next generation?",2015,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The 2001 Census for England and Wales was only the second census in Great Britain to include a question about religion (the first was in 1851). Analysing the data from the 2001 Census, sociologists found that baby girls were more likely than baby boys to be ‘Christian’(Voas & McAndrew 2012). Does this pattern persist in the 2011 Census? Voas and McAndrew suggest that the religion assigned to a young child is influenced by the religion of the child’s parents. They suggest that in a family where both parents are Christian, male and female children are likely to be identified as Christian. Likewise, in a family where both parents select “no religion”, both male and female children are likely to be assigned “no religion”. However, when the parents have different religions, children tend to be assigned the religion of the same-sex parent. Of course, this raises yet another question: why are men more likely than women to say that they have “no religion”? This phenomenon is not confined to Britain but has been identified in numerous other surveys (Hayes 2000). Some researchers have looked to evolution to explain these sex differences (Norenzayan et al. 2012), whilst others favour more social or cultural explanations (Trzebiatowska & Bruce 2012). Without a consensus on this issue, the puzzle of why young boys are more “non-religious” than young girls remains, at present, only partially solved."

All the relevant indicators seem to suggest that this is a social movement and I think there is a need for more research in this area to better understand it as a movement. All I am going to suggest is that there is a coherent and relatively uniform agenda for the various social movement participants – both among organizations and among individual activists – and that the common agenda may hold some promise in determining the name."

But I wish to argue in this article that through the study of the nonreligious and their relationship towards religion, we can also gain a new understanding of religion itself. If we look at common definitions of religion, they typically frame our understanding of religion through its meaning for the religious alone. What religion might mean for the nonreligious – or for the “rest” of society – is not included, and remains a blind spot in the understanding of religion. But in societies with strong religious populations or governments, religion influences many areas of public and private life. Religion creates power relationships, especially when it is implemented in political processes or when majorities stand against minorities, be they religious or nonreligious. I refer to this as religious normation, and I’ll illustrate what I mean by this with some remarks about the United States. This requires a new definition of religion that encompasses these complexities. Therefore I propose a definition of religion as a cultural set of beliefs, norms, and practices with reference to a transcendent being or principle, which is held by parts of a society and may be applied particularly or universally through positive or negative sanctions, and whose bindingness depends on religion’s influence on the respective group."

Men tend to be the public faces of religious communities, but women participate more actively in religious activities, they pray more, and overall, religion plays a larger role in their lives. In addition, women rarely identify as atheists (Mahlamäki 2012: 60-61). Recently, this was seen in a study published by the UCL Institute of Education. The study showed that whereas 54% of British men born in 1970 identify as atheists, the figure among women is only 34% (Voas 2015). For a historian of non-religion, these results sound anything but new. The difference in religiosity between the genders had already been acknowledged by both the religious majority and the non-believers themselves 200 years ago. Here I reflect on the theme of gender and irreligiosity in the context of the 19th century United States, which is also the focus of my on-going PhD dissertation. Through looking at the ‘lived non-belief’ of these women, it might also be possible to shed light on the nature of female non-belief. In addition to women being statistically more religious, their religiousness and irreligiousness seems to be different from that of men. For example, studies have suggested that compared to men, women are more eclectic and more tolerant to contradiction in their beliefs (Mahlamäki 2012, p. 60-61). Though finding the voices of these women is a challenging task, especially those who were not part of any organised movements, it is indeed a task worth taking on."

In some of this coverage, the incident was reduced to an attack on secular freedom. This not only failed to capture the complexity of the events. It also failed to reflect accurately the tangled histories of secular ideas, political settlements, and ways of living in the west and the Arab Middle East, shaped by centuries of interaction, including empire and migration. The so-called ‘War on Terror’ was an important chapter in these tangled histories. War is always a social and cultural encounter between sides. One of the by-products of this terrible chapter was the re-assertion of orientalist binaries. Another, less appreciated by-product was increased western policy and media attention to the terms of western secularism."
“Non-event” report: Why the Sunday Assembly event did not launch in Japan,Yutaka Osakabe,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,M,Isaac Gagné,Waseda University,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Yutaka Osakabe and Isaac Gagné explore what we can learn from the absence of the Sunday Assembly [SA] in Japan, despite some interest in setting it up.

Discussions around the SA have raised a number of meaningful questions over any strict distinction between religion and non-religion. This post, however, takes a slightly different approach, by exploring what difficulties the SA might face when they attempt to expand their movement outside the post-Christendom west. How do the SA attempt to address any challenges they face during expansion and indeed if they are interested in overcoming such difficulties? These questions follow an attempt to participate in a launch event for SA in Japan. As it turned out, the launch was a ‘non-event’. In the face of the usual positive, success story of the SA this ‘non-event’ seemed to offer the possibility of reflection on failure, and some raised new questions about the SA. Ironically, comparison with the Japanese context helps bring our attention to how the SA is operated within a western (or Christian) framework both in motivation and style. In Shusaku Endo’s novel Silence, a Jesuit missionary, who was sent to 17th century Japan, described Japan as a “mud swamp”, to express the difficulties he faced as a missionary. Here, Christianity seemed to grow but died soon after because the wet ground putrefied the roots. If ministers uttered similar laments about Japan today, it would not be surprising. The question remains if the SA will have to face similar challenges in their attempts to expand their group in a country such as Japan where there is no shared framework with their mission. Just like Christian missionaries today, does the SA have to struggle with contextualising their own ideology?"

Research generally shows that those who believe in God and go to church have an overall more powerful sense of purpose and meaning in life, although some recent studies nuance these conclusions. My research illustrates that secularly-oriented societies have found other ways of providing meaning and purpose for their citizens through providing social institutions that offered many of the same benefits as churches do in the US. To understand how the USSR’s government helped its citizens gain a greater sense of meaning and purpose, I spent over a decade investigating government reports in archives across the Soviet Union, exploring national and local newspapers, read memoirs and diaries, and interviewed over fifty former Soviet citizens as part of my PhD research."

My interest here is with religious nones, who comprise 24% of the Canadian adult population (Statistics Canada 2013) and 32% of Canadian teens (Bibby 2011, 51). Drawing on thirty interviews with religious nones, what are the perceived benefits for identifying as a religious none? What are their beliefs about the supernatural, about meaning and purpose in life as well as the afterlife, about morality, and their aversion to religion that is forced on to others? The findings below build on observations from other NSRN blogs on a range of beliefs held by those with no religion, particularly Gleb Tsipursky’s article “Meaning and Purpose in Non-Religious Societies.” Three brief conclusions stand out. First, religious nones are heterogeneous in the beliefs that they adopt. Second, religious nones are content with their life and their worldview – they do not think they are missing anything because they do not identify with a religion. Third, religious nones (in Canada at least) hold strongly to the position that religious or irreligious perspectives should not be forced on to others. These findings validate and extend the growing research discovered by many associated with NSRN, on individuals and societies that are increasingly secular and diverse; findings that I address in a distinct Canadian social climate (as opposed to American or British) in my book."

Based on the idea that a militant, aggressive and intolerant form of secularism is trying to marginalise faith and drive it out of the public square, anti-secular rhetoric has found growing popularity among political as well as religious figures (particularly those associated with the Christian faith) aiming to promote a greater role for faith in the public realm. The interests and motives behind the new anti-secularism, however, are substantively divergent, and the prospects of success are slim. For religious actors the main concerns centre on the progressive impact of secularization and the on-going decline of religious influence in British society and culture. In this case the use of anti-secular discourse forms part of a broader strategic move towards a form of identity politics based on a language of minority rights and demands for religious freedom. The promotion of anti-secular discourse by political actors is driven by a markedly different set of concerns. Here the main issues have been shaped by the changing nature of governance and (in particular) the electoral merits of the Conservative party."

How About Your Brother?’: The Universal Life Church between Religion and Non-Religion”,Dusty Hoesly,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"National media outlets have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or lifecycle rituals conducted under its auspices. According to my original survey, interview, and participant observation data, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them typically self-describe as non-religious, usually as spiritual, seekers, humanist, or generically “not religious.” Similarly, they describe their weddings in “non-religious” terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most “religious” language. These “secular” or “spiritual” wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. This article explains why “secular” people select ULC ministers for their weddings, how ULC ministers see themselves as “non-religious” while being members of a legally-recognized religion, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC membership and weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as “religious” and “secular” can be co-constitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.

Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis to determine overarching themes, while the three-fold typology of apostasy developed by Zuckerman (2012) allowed the authors to examine similarities and differences between older and younger women who choose to leave religion behind.

We give six examples of empirical studies showing that the theory of religious-secular competition explains such contrasting phenomena as the difference in success of religious healing in European and African countries, the diminishing and change of religious socialization in Switzerland, variations in church attendance in U.S. states, variation in the attractiveness of monasteries, the late secularization of Ireland, or the success of megachurches since the 1970s.",2015,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.,.

As one of America’s most stigmatized groups, atheists often find members of their own families reacting with anger and rejection, an inability to communicate effectively, and distrust. Many atheists, however, feel continued support and acceptance from family members, experience greater authenticity in their communication, and enjoy relationships with family members who manage to adapt to the atheist’s disclosure of nonbelief. This qualitative study reports the experiences of 80 atheists when they tell family members that they do not believe in God.

To date, however, no studies have taken a reflexive approach to these themes or applied them in the field to test their analytical utility as well as their relations in contemporary atheist experience. This study employs a mixed-methods approach that includes in-depth interviews (n = 19), participant observation, and one survey administered to two atheist groups, one local (n = 151) and one national (n = 456). Ethnographic findings confirm the central role of stigma, identity, and community in atheist experience and emphasize their nestedness in one another. Survey results find that atheist affiliates in both national and local groups rate political activism as more important than social reasons in motivating them to affiliate, while local affiliates rated social reasons significantly higher than national affiliates rated social reasons. Suggestions for future research include consideration of these themes’ connectedness in subsequent analyses and further inquiry into the functional divergences between local and national atheist organizations.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.

The Roots of Right and Wrong: Do Concepts of Innate Morality Reduce Intuitive Associations of Immorality With Atheism?,Tommy L. Mudd,University of Kentucky,Kentucky,M,Maxine B.

Previous research suggests that anti-atheist prejudice may stem in part from perceptions of religion as an ultimate basis for morality: without God, why do good (or not do bad)? We conducted two studies to test whether presenting recent scientific findings regarding the nonreligious bases of morality (e.g., morality in nonhuman primates and preverbal infants) might lead people to view morality as innate, thus reducing intuitive associations of immorality and atheism. Consistent with previous research, participants viewed moral transgressions as more representative of atheists than of Christians. However, learning about the putatively innate nature of morality did not lead participants to view immorality as less representative of atheists. Intuitive moral distrust of atheists appears quite resilient, persisting even in the face of evidence for the nonreligious origins of morality.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.,.

One of the most common mistakes researchers in human sciences make, using qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods, is to state that 'the data’ are saying something. Data say nothing. The researcher says it all through the subjective experience of conducting research; and all research in human sciences is subjective from the moment the research question is formed, through the research design, to the questions being asked and the conclusions drawn. Methodologically, realising that data don’t 'speak’ – or, at least, that they are part of a broader conversation in which the researcher has played a determining role – is important because it creates a constant state of tension, uncertainty and, ideally, reflexivity in the researcher. For the study of nonreligious belief, this realisation can also free researchers from the strictures of preconceived concepts of what 'unbelief’ entails, whilst still allowing us to work with those concepts constructively instead of discarding them altogether."
Understanding Unbelief – project launch,Lois Lee,University of Kent,England,F,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,Miguel Farias,Coventry University,England,M,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This plenary session introduces the Understanding Unbelief project, a major new research initiative in the study of nonreligion. This session will introduce the project and the opportunities it aims to provide researchers of atheism and other forms of unbelief and nonreligion around the world. It will also introduce methodological resources newly available for researchers working in these areas. The growth of atheism and other forms of ‘unbelief’ in many parts of the world is attracting increasingly wide attention, with many commentators attempting to address the causes of ‘unbelief’ and its effects on a range of outcomes such as personal well-being and social cohesion. Yet significant questions remain about how to understand such phenomena, and researchers and commentators still often rely on categories developed by social actors (e.g. atheism, unbelief, agnosticism, etc.) rather than social scientists. If we are to advance our scientific understanding in these areas, we need to account for the diverse psychological and social phenomena and processes subsumed under such broad terms as atheism and unbelief. We do not currently know how best to characterize the various forms of unbelief as psychological and sociological phenomena, the extent to which other beliefs – existential beliefs, or beliefs about religion, etc. – underpin these forms, how diverse they are, and how they vary across demographic groups and cultures. Yet understanding the nature and variety of unbelief is necessary if we are, in the future, to adequately answer enduring questions about the causes of ‘unbelief’ and its effects on wellbeing cohesion. With generous backing from the John Templeton Foundation, the Understanding Unbelief project aims to be the first major scientific research program to address the nature and variety of unbelief. It is designed to include (i) substantial grant competitions to generate multidisciplinary research into diverse forms of unbelief across demographic groups and cultural settings, and (ii) core interdisciplinary research working across these forms, groups, and settings to build a more integrated understanding of unbelief. Moreover, the project aims to provide a range of methodological and conceptual resources for researchers and applicants, including a flourishing multidisciplinary blog on methods for investigating unbelief, state of the art literature reviews, seminar series, and a new Oxford Dictionary of Atheism (OUP, 2016).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
“The Diversity of Nonreligion:” Religious-Nonreligious Entanglements in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Philippines,Johannes Quack,University of Zurich,Switzerland,M,Alexander Blechschmidt,University of Zurich,Switzerland,M,Cora Schuh,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,Susanne Schenk,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The research project “The Diversity of Nonreligion” was funded from 2012 to 2016 by the German Research Council (DFG). As part of our “closing conference” and the annual NSRN conference we present selected conceptual and empirical findings. Our research focuses on four countries with quite distinct social, political, cultural and religious contexts: the Netherlands, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. In all of them, the differentiation from religion, while at the same time being related to respective religious phenomena, played a decisive role for nonreligious actors and their identity construction as well as their social and political activism. Based on the work in our project, we will firstly present our conceptual framework for researching nonreligion relationally, which is inspired by sociological field theory (e.g. Bourdieu). Secondly, we will describe and discuss some of our main research findings based on our empirical case studies in three countries (the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Philippines). In the context of a changing religious field, as well as a changing nonreligious constituency, Swedish humanists are engaged in a struggle about the adequate way of relating to, or disentangling from religion. In the Philippines, in relation to a politicized opposition to the “hegemony” of the Catholic Church and a gradual integration into global nonreligious networks, freethinkers and atheists are constantly negotiating their respective forms of “collective nonreligiosity”. Taking a slightly different angle, the third case study focuses on the struggles of a social-liberal party in the Netherlands for disentangling politics from religion, thereby also having to engage with questions of what nonreligious politics would be based on. We will outline such different relational assemblages, which give insights into the conjunction of these nonreligious groups’ relationships to actors whom they regard as the “religious” as well as those whom they perceive to be their “nonreligious others”.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Pathways to Organizational Involvement Among Nonbelievers,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research on non-religion has often sampled for nonbelievers via their connections to nonreligious organizations. Making assumptions about nonbelievers as a whole, then, can problematic, since only a portion of nonbelievers are likely to be involved with such groups. Joining a nonreligious organization satisfies a desire for community for some nonbelievers, but social research has not adequately explained why some nonbelievers join while others do not. If nonbelievers are looking for social interaction, intellectual debate, or secular spiritual fulfillment, they can potentially find it via a nonreligious organization; however, organizational affiliation could be a sufficient but unnecessary means of achieving personal goals. This prompts me to ask, what is the difference between the joining and the non-joining nonbeliever? Have they taken different pathways to non-belief and do they experience nonbelief in significantly different ways? In order to determine why some nonbelievers choose not to participate in collective action, and to assess the actual impact of organizations on those who do, non-joiners should be compared to organization members, who may differ systematically from those who join. To answer these questions I interviewed 125 nonbelievers in Houston, Texas, most of whom were involved to varying degrees with nonreligious organizations, but many that were not. I examined respondents’ religious backgrounds, journeys to non-belief, “coming out” experiences, and organizational affiliations to search for similarities and differences in these two groups of nonbelievers.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

The MS framework, which was designed to encompass both religious and nonreligious meaning systems, allows us to conceptualize our object of study in generic terms. It offers a dynamic framework that has already generated a body of empirical research on the interaction between meaning systems (implicit and explicit) and meaning making in particular situations. Although much of this research has focused on how people cope with trauma, psychologists have extended it to other contexts, including conversion and spiritual transformation. Here I suggest we can build on the framework’s basic distinction between global meaning systems (GMS) and situational meaning (SM) by elaborating the concept of GMS in light of the literature on worldviews and the concept of SM in light of 'situational’ elements, such as practices, networks, institutions, and ways of life, that are typically studied by scholars of religion under the rubric of 'lived religion.’"
Researching the nonreligious in a secular society,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. The visibility of religion in society is low and nonreligiosity is considered normative. Estonians are also one of the nations (along with Czechs) in Europe who’s national identity is associated with atheism, in both cases expressed as “the most atheistic country in the world”. Nevertheless, different beliefs and practices associated with New Spirituality and indigenous Earth belief are very common. Thus, secularity in this context refers mostly to distance from conventional, theistic religion. The paper draws on the data from recent quantitative survey “On Life, Religion, and Religious Life” (2015). Among other questions, the survey offered participants two different possibilities for (non)religious identification, employing also the concept of Multiple Religious Belonging. Beside the information on religiosity, the results of the analysis also give interesting information about nonreligious identities in a secular context. Still, general results of the survey awoke serious doubts about the suitability of quantitative survey on conventional religion in a largely nonreligious society. In order to investigate the relevance of the quantitative survey, I conducted a qualitative study among the nonreligious using mainly the same questions and offering a possibility to explain one’s answers. The results largely confirmed my doubts. The paper addresses the issues that became clear during the qualitative study.

Interpreting Active Forms of Atheism and Secularism as a Social Movement,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the wake of so-called „New Atheism“, especially organized forms of nonreligion, atheism, and/or secularism have attracted an unprecedented degree of scholarly attention (see e.g. Cimino and Smith 2014, LeDrew 2016). These studies, mostly on the North American spectrum of atheist, humanist, and secularist organizations, have treated their subject, quite matter-of-factly, as a social movement. In my presentation, I would like to apply theoretical insight from the sociology of social movements to the study of nonreligion and secularity – more specifically to atheist, humanist, and secularist activism in the United States and Germany. On the one hand, I would like to analyze systematically in how far the field of organized and non-organized atheism, humanism, and secularism meets definitions of a social movement and in how far it can justifiably be called that. Most definitions of social movements place emphasis on the existence of formal and informal networks of collective and individual actors, a shared identity, a battle against political or cultural enemies, and the use of non-institutionalized means. So, on the other hand, I am going to portray the formal and informal networks in this field as well as recent dynamics and divergencies with respect to identity, opponents, and strategy using theories of collective action and collective identity. The aim of my paper, therefore, is both theoretical as well as descriptive: bringing theory from the sociology of social movements to fruition in the context of a new subject matter and broadening the empirical treatment of that subject matter to a European case.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Making implicit nonreligious attitudes visible: secular criticism of religion and spirituality within societal institutions,Christiane Königstedt,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The study of nonreligion is, besides analyses of state secularism, very often concerned with nonreligious persons in the minority position, who are themselves perceived as contestations to religious world-views. For the opposite case, i.e. secular societies where nonreligious world-views are also dominant, Charles Taylor and José Casanova (2011) stated, that the latter would have the tendency to “naturalize” and thus become unconsciously held attitudes. Since what is taken for granted is rarely mentioned explicitly as well as there is by no means a canonized set of nonreligious beliefs collectively shared, those are difficult investigate beyond visible conflicts provoked by either religious groups or by perceived transgressions of taken-for-granted secular realms. Contestations and resulting negotiations may constitute a chance for the researcher (Knott 2007) to investigate 'naturalized’ assumptions, when it is explicated in order to explain the criticism groups, beliefs or practices. While it has shown that collective actors, groups, are more likely to be differentiated from the “in-group” through evoking a secular collective identity, subtle punctual transgressions of boundaries may reveals details about more diffused nonreligious – and implicit – attitudes and opinions. In this paper I will analyse examples for the latter case, precisely a sample of criticism(s) expressed in German online-newspapers towards perceived transgressions of legitimate (often medical) science by religio-spiritual world-views. Testing Taylor’s and Casanova’s claim in this practical area, the pivotal questions are 'what is precisely perceived as challenge and how is it characterized’? What is, on the other hand, perceived to be in need of protection, what are the feared dangers? What singular arguments and values are explicated in that defence? The findings from the material shall be discussed concerning their significance and surplus value for the study of nonreligion.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Early-Modern Irreligion and Theological Analogy: A Response to Gavin Hyman’s A Short History of Atheism,Daniel J. Linford,Thomas Nelson Community College,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Historically, many Christians have understood God’s transcendence to imply God’s properties categorically differ from any created properties. For multiple historical figures, a problem arose for religious language: how can one talk of God at all if none of our predicates apply to God? What are we to make of creeds and Biblical passages that seem to predicate creaturely properties, such as goodness and wisdom, of God? Thomas Aquinas offered a solution: God is to be spoken of only through analogy (the doctrine of analogy). Gavin Hyman argues Aquinas’s doctrine of analogy was neglected prior to the early-modern period and the neglect of analogy produced the conception of a god vulnerable to atheistic arguments. Contra Hyman, in this paper, I show early-modern atheism arose in a theological context in which there was an active debate concerning analogy. Peter Browne (1665–1735) and William King (1650–1729) offered two competing conceptions of analogical predication that were debated through the 19th century, with interlocutors such as the freethinker Anthony Collins (1676–1729), theologian/philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and skeptic David Hume (1711–1776). Lastly, I discuss the 18th century debate over theological analogy as part of the background relevant to understanding Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

From their recent research they detail the particular obstacles they overcame and elucidate how different questions on measuring non-belief produce much different answers.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In quantitative analysis, atheism is often used as a concept to describe those who state that they do not believe, when asked what they believe about God or those that indicate that they are not a member of a religious organization. It seems as if researchers treat atheism as the 'residual category’ in their study of religion. However, the recent debate on atheism, religious 'nones’ and non-religiosity suggests that this sociological habit of categorizing non-believers and non-affiliates as atheists, does not do justice to the intricacies of the atheist identity. There exists a great difference between say, an attender of an atheist gathering like the Sunday Assembly and a supporter of the American Atheists movement. Therefore, quantitatively oriented scholars should be very careful in their operationalization of the tolerant and almost spiritual kind of atheism on the one hand (better described as non-religious or a-religious), and the militant and provocative atheism on the other (better depicted as anti-religious). In our recent studies on non-religiosity and anti-religiosity in Western Europe, we discovered that operationalizing these differences is not so easy. We encountered three particular obstacles. First, the commonly used surveys for the study of religion, culture, and politics (for instance, EVS, ISSP) use different questions for measuring similar religious beliefs and attitudes. Second, they have very few items that lend themselves to distinguishing anti-religiosity from non-religiosity in general and religious indifference in particular. Third, there are a limited number of options for operationalizing different kinds of anti-religiosity, for example anti-Muslim sentiment. Now, researchers like us have two options: we could decide to dismiss datasets designed to measure religiosity as useless for understanding non-religiosity; or we could gloss over the differences and imagine that non-religiosity really is quite a straightforward matter. With this blog, we describe the way in which we overcame these pitfalls."

Rather, such findings are relevant for understanding more indirect causes of people’s behavior and for explaining why certain types of explicit beliefs are more easily spread. When studying implicit processes in the context of religion and nonreligion, researchers have utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. A common methodological feature that these studies share is that they assess people’s beliefs indirectly. This means that, instead of asking the participants to report their own evaluation of the effects of their beliefs, participants are not fully aware of the particular beliefs the researchers are measuring."

In this post, I want to discuss a specific issue that continues to stifle the nascent field of what we might call “spirituality studies.” It seems to me that those of us interested in “spirituality” have not yet figured out how to adequately study this puzzling phenomenon.

British Ex-Muslims: Constructing and negotiating the 'essential and revolutionary',Halima Begum,Birkbeck University of London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The phenomenon of people leaving their religion is a common feature of many post-Christian Western societies. However, the investigation of the phenomenon of apostasy has mainly been restricted to Christian apostates. Apostasy in minority communities, specifically the Muslim community, is not well understood. This study investigates the why and the how of the construction of the 'Ex-Muslim' identity, defined as atheists and agnostics who have left Islam. A small-scale study with a qualitative, grounded theory approach within a social constructivism paradigm was used to explore the construction of the Ex-Muslim identity, and how Ex-Muslims managed and negotiated the stigma attached to their identity. Ten semistructured interviews and one focus group (five participants) were conducted to investigate why participants chose to call themselves 'Ex-Muslims' and what the consequences of embracing this identity were. Results revealed two dimensions to understand this identity. The first category conceptualises the stigmatisation from Muslim and the non-Muslim society, and a displacement of the self, lack of parental acceptance and gendered experiences as the defining factors in the realities of Ex-Muslims. The second category showed the strategies used to navigate the Ex-Muslim identity, consisting of a complex set of performance acts to manage social interactions as well as the construction of an Ex-Muslim community. The results show that the conditions of stigmatisation of apostasy can stimulate the displacement of the self, resulting into an evolving Ex-Muslim identity. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of negotiation of identities through performances (Goffman, 1963) as well as the concept of the 'ex' role identity (Ebaugh, 1988).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

Much has been made about the works of New Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, but relatively little has been done to analyze how they are consumed and reproduced, interpreted and critiqued, by everyday atheists. I address the tension between contemporary atheists’ skepticism regarding traditional authority and their simultaneous acceptance of some modes and sources of authority. Atheists themselves are aware of this tension, and treat it thoughtfully, playfully, and self-reflexively (jokingly calling Dawkins, for example, the Atheist Pope). I also connect my observations about authority in contemporary atheism with a commentary about gender in today’s atheist network, a subject for which my cultural sources provide rich material.

Despite collapses in trust and practice since the promulgation of the clerical sexual abuse scandals from the early 1990s onwards and a swiftly growing minority identifying as non-religious, survey data still return unusually high levels of religious belief and affiliation in Ireland by European standards, something that has led sociologists to propose that by and large the Irish population remain 'believers’ and 'cultural Catholics’ despite their growing lack of institutional engagement (Davie, 1994; Donnelly & Inglis, 2009). My research examines the accuracy of this characterisation utilising a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Dublin with experimental techniques built on a theoretical standpoint taken from the cognitive science of religion. These experiments aim to directly test whether religious credence is undermined when cultural learners witness 'Credibility Undermining Displays’, namely instances where religious paragons fail to 'practice what they preach’ (Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012). My presentation will cover the preliminary data yielded by these experiments, and compliment this with the more nuanced qualitative findings drawn from my fieldwork and interviews among informants from two Dublin parishes. Together, it is hoped that these preliminary findings will suggest insights regarding how exactly the discrediting of the Church relates to contemporary Irish secularization.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
“They Just Don’t Stand for Nothing”: LGBT Christians’ Definitions of Non-Religious Others,Jason Edward Sumerau,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this exploratory study, I examine how a group of LGBT Christians conceptualized non-religious others. Based on over 450 hours of fieldwork in an LGBT Christian church located in the southeastern region of the United States, I demonstrate how a group of LGBT Christians defined non-religious others as (1) morally suspect and untrustworthy, (2) in need of salvation and guidance, and (3) poor representations of the LGBT community. Although these LGBT Christians used “non-religious” as a catchall term without ever specifying exactly who it captured, they used the first two definitions to apply to non-religious people in general regardless of sexuality while explicitly focusing on non-religious sexual minorities in their third definition. Moreover, I show how these definitions echoed mainstream religious rhetoric in America used to marginalize both sexual and religious minorities. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how religious depictions of non-religious people may reproduce societal patterns of inequality; and (2) the importance of analyzing how religious people define and interpret non-religious others.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

He argues that Japanese nonreligiousness has altered strategies of Japanese Christian missions and influenced the bridal industry.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Statistically speaking, the vast majority of contemporary Japanese self-identify as nonreligious. However, this self-identification is far from a wholesale rejection of religion, and often employed both to reject and affirm religious behaviors and identities. Most typically, nonreligious attitudes reject religious dispositions that are perceived as deviant, unhealthy, or foreign while simultaneously affirming religion’s importance. Nonreligious individuals tend to rely on religious professionals and vicariously entrust specialized acts of prayer and ritual to religious authorities when desirable and appropriate. Along with various Buddhist and Shinto rites, Christian wedding ceremonies are now one of the occasions where nonreligious Japanese rely on religious professionals. Nonreligious attitudes are responsible for significant transformations in Japanese Christianity and the bridal industry and the successful response of the Christian churches and the bridal industry to consumer demand has led to an explosion in Christian wedding ceremonies. In short, the popularity of Christian weddings among nonreligious individuals has transformed the policies and approaches of Christian churches and created new Christian ritual venues and religious organizations."
Kids, You Make the Choice: Religious and Secular Socialization among Marginal Affiliates and Nonreligious Individuals,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"What approaches do parents or those who plan to have children employ to socialize their children about religious or secular identification, beliefs, and practices? In what ways do primary and secondary socialization agents interact in this process? How might cultural narratives shape or be shaped by primary and secondary socialization activities? I address these questions by drawing on sixty interviews with two groups of Canadians – those who identify with a Christian group but limit attendance to religious holidays and rites of passage (marginal affiliates), and those who do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services (nonreligious individuals). I found that marginal affiliates did or planned to expose their children to religious belief and practice, while nonreligious individuals were inclined to defer to their children. However, marginal affiliates and nonreligious individuals jointly maintained that children should have choice in this matter. Parents did not or planned not to impose religious or secular views on children. Further, one’s upbringing informed parental socialization strategies and tactics that were largely informed by prevailing Canadian cultural narratives.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.,.

Consequently, I began to investigate atheism with the cognitive and evolutionary sciences in mind, conducting fieldwork with atheist and humanist groups in the US, UK, and Denmark and running interviews, surveys, and experiments. Taking a cognitive perspective, I believe, allows us to escape the post-modern malaise that too-often arises when we recognize the socially-constructed nature of our key objects of analysis.  In short, a cognitive perspective helps make the scientific study of atheism possible."
On the Necessity of Fractionating “Atheism”,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Can “atheism,” be an object of scientific analysis? Academics and other social actors approach “atheism” with a range of interests, producing substantial diversity in how the term is defined, analysed, and utilised. Given the importance of such interests in conceptual construction, one may ask whether “atheism” exists as an independent phenomenon amenable to scientific analysis, or, rather, following the supposed fate of “religion” (Smith, 1998; Fitzgerald, 2000) and the “secular” (Asad, 2003), as a mere social construction. This question is not without consequence. If “atheism” only exists as a socially constructed concept and not as an independent object, then analysis of its supposed causes and effects becomes, like astrology, folly. I will argue that “atheism” is indeed a social construct. This would seem to doom any scientific study of atheism and leave us only to document how the term is experienced and utilized by various social actors. However, I will argue that a science of atheism is still possible. To do so, I will utilize the metatheoretical principle of “fractionation” developed by cognitive anthropologists (Boyer, 1994; Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014) in their scientific studies of “religion.” Fractionating a constructed object of analysis involves breaking it up into distinct phenomena about whose independence we are more confident and which may have divergent causes and effects. Based on my field and survey research with atheists in the US, UK, and Denmark, as well as insights from the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, I will propose three (non-exhaustive) fractionated elements of “atheism:” 1) absence of (implicit/explicit) belief in the existence of God/gods, 2) moral judgement of the immorality of “religion,” and 3) social identities that prominently feature “atheism” or other forms of “nonreligion.” I will argue that each exists in the world beyond our scholarly conceptions and with distinct sets of causes and effects.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Reimagining the Secular: The Sunday Assembly - Belonging without Believing.,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Grace Davie (1994) famously wrote over two decades ago that 'the overall pattern of religious life is changing. For it appears that more and more people within British Society want to believe but do not want to involve themselves in religious practice.’ Hence, the catchphrase 'believing without belonging’ was coined. Twenty-two years later has the (non)religious landscape changed once again? My doctoral research follows the Sunday Assembly, a secular congregation that celebrates life, with the motto: live better, help often and wonder more. Their vision is: to help everyone live life as fully as possible. The Sunday Assembly entered the non-religious market place in January 2013 with their flagship London congregation. Now, 68- franchised chapters of the Godless congregation exist in 8 different countries, attempting to provide community, belonging and wonder to the religiously unaffiliated market. Once described as 'the best bits of church but with no religion and with awesome pop songs!’, the best bits literally borrow established successful terminology, practices, liturgies and models of building community found within Christian churches. Often labelled oxymoronically the 'atheist church’ - it parallels and mimics the functionality of church life without the need for a deity. Therefore, studying the Sunday Assembly may offer a new variation to Davie’s 'believing without belonging’ that is 'belonging without believing.’ As more and more people now identify as being non-religious in the United Kingdom and America, this paper will aim to answer what factors are enticing people towards the Sunday Assembly and their nonreligious practice. This paper will present findings from my analysis of the Sunday Assembly. Drawing upon 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews and a year-long ethnography spent with the London Sunday Assembly congregation.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.
Non-Religious Individuals’ Life Satisfaction: Examining the Role of Belief Certainty and Context Factors,Katharina Pöhls,University of Cologne,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Based on the assumption of a curvilinear effect of belief certainty instead of belief content on psychological well-being, this individual paper explores the influence of belief certainty on non-religious individuals’ life satisfaction with regard to the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development. Self-identification as atheist is used as an indicator for non-religiousness with a high belief certainty. The social norm of non-religiosity is indicated by the national level of individuals identifying as not religious or atheist and the level of societal development is indicated by the level of a population’s health, education, and standard of living. The World Values Survey is used as data source for a quantitative intercultural comparison across 31 countries (N=49,611). Results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average more satisfied with life than atheist and non-religious individuals when only including individual-level variables in the analysis, but that they do not differ in their average level of life satisfaction when interactions with the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development are considered. Additionally, the difference between atheist and religious individuals’ life satisfaction decreases with higher levels of non-religiosity in society. It will be discussed why these results challenge the assumption of religiosity being related to a general advantage concerning individuals’ well-being.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

So what causes anti-atheist prejudice both inside and outside of the political arena?  Why are atheists viewed so negatively in the United States, even by other atheists? To help answer these questions, we might consider a new study conducted by psychologists Corey L. Cook, Florette Cohen, and Sheldon Solomon (2015) entitled What If They’re Right About the Afterlife?  Evidence of the Role of Existential Threat on Anti-Atheist Prejudice. Adding to the ever-growing body of research on anti-atheist prejudice, which has already connected such prejudice to concerns about atheists being untrustworthy and threatening to in-group values, this study focused on the existential threat that atheism poses to theistic worldviews. Specifically, the researchers based their hypotheses on terror management theory, originally developed by Solomon himself along with two other psychologists, which posits that “the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror that is assuaged by cultural worldviews that afford a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe,” in order to see whether atheists, by holding to a worldview which denies a belief in God or an afterlife, threaten to undermine the terror-buffer that religious worldviews often generate. In brief, the two separate experiments in this study found a significant empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudice."

I intended the book as a response to, and partly a reaction against, the 'religious turn’ in gender and feminist history of the last 20 years or so. But Infidel Feminism, was also intended as an intervention into scholarship on secularism, to say something new about the category of the secular as a whole and to take forward debates on the secularization thesis and 'post-secularity’.

By using a historical case study, Fraser hopes to push back against viewing atheism as either a purely political or purely intellectual phenomenon and instead suggests that only a multi-disciplinary study can fully make sense of atheism.",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"It is a common belief in many Western societies that politics and religion should be separate, and that religion should play little or no role in the governance of modern states. This belief, in turn, can support two other assumptions: first, that it is possible to have religious beliefs whose significance is purely intellectual, and which possess no political meaning; and second, that the absence or rejection of religious language, symbols, and narratives in political life implies neutrality or indifference toward the intellectual cogency of religious belief. These beliefs can affect the methodologies we use, as is seen in different approaches toward New Atheism. On the one hand are a range of polemical works that seek to defend or refute the intellectual plausibility of its core arguments, with little consideration of its social and political significance. On the other hand are works by Schulzke, Kettell, and McAnulla, which have sought to move beyond this intellectual and polemical approach by conceptualising New Atheism as a primarily political movement. In contrast to these overly intellectual or political methods, historians of Protestant freethought such as Budd, Reventlow, and Champion have long noted the inter-dependent relationship between atheism, theology, and political protest."
Jewish Atheists, Protestant Humanists and Nonreligious Agnostics: Existential Culture, 'Hybridity’ and Nonreligious Diversity,Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The existential dimension of human life has been a minor theme in contemporary social science, in line with the dominant view in social theory (e.g. modernization theory, secularization theory) that the decline of religion, detraditionalisation and other processes of social transformation serve to diminish existential experience in modern and late modern societies. In contrast to such theories, this paper presents evidence that existential life is reformed rather than reduced in contemporary societies. It draws on qualitative research exploring nonreligious identification in southeast England to demonstrate the ways in which informants engage with the existential and metaphysical, not only through thought and belief, but also through rituals, symbolic forms and social interactions. It shows how the variety and cultural contingency of these existential cultures can provide new ways to understand the diversity of nonreligious beliefs and cultures. It also points to commonalities and opportunities for cultural exchange between religious, spiritual and nonreligious existential cultures, and the ways in which individuals may draw on and sometimes combine these different traditions. I argue that a cultural turn in understandings of atheism, nonreligion and secularity help us to understand these complex or 'hybrid’ existential cultural formations.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

However, today, the issue is not the same as it was for researchers a decade ago – pioneering new empirical projects and trying to get to grips with long taken-for-granted concepts like 'atheism’ and 'irreligion’ in order to do so. For new scholars, the challenge is accessing all that these earlier scholars have learned – and ensuring that they don’t have to repeat the same conceptual explorations, or wander up the blind alleys that others have already realised are dead-ends. Today, the issue is much more about having a centralised body of work to turn to, a point of access to a resource setting out, simply and clearly, what others have already learned. To date, there has been a lack of standardization, not only across disciplines but within them, leading either to uncertainty about a concept’s meaning or crossed-wires. What is more, lacking a centralised conceptual resource limits scholars opportunities to scrutinise and develop core concepts in light of new knowledge, to build more nuanced models, and to triangulate and accumulate knowledge."

From the very outset – the point of research design – we need to decide on the issue to be explained. Take, for example, the striking gender imbalance in the atheist movement – one of the most prominent gender issues in the field. Why so few women? It may then be the case that women do not differ from men in their initial attraction to atheist activities, but the gap widens as a result of women’s direct experience of the atheist milieu. The initial gendering of the atheist movement, through the high profiles of its male figures and marginalisation of their female counterparts, sets the tone for the subsequent patterns of participation. The focus on atheism in studies of nonreligion is also inevitably gendered because the term 'atheist’ tends to appeal more to men than to women who prefer 'agnostic’ or 'not religious’."
Contested Secularism(s) in Bangladesh,Mascha Schulz,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism and the role of religion in the public sphere in Bangladesh have been highly contested issues in Bangladesh since a long period, but contestation and polarization have regained remarkable intensity in the recent past. In this context also the academic writing on the issue of secularism, national identity and religion in Bangladesh and concomitant conflicts has remerged with new impetus. In this presentation I will explore the light that recent academic writing sheds on contested secularism in Bangladesh. I will summarize the existing literature by pointing to different narratives and motives frequently presented in the literature. This will help us to understand how these contestations around religion and secularism in Bangladesh are commonly interpreted and how various issues and conflicts are conflated within these debates. As a second step, I will discuss to which extend the scholarly works can themselves be considered as part of politics around the contested issue of “secularism” and the role of religion in Bangladesh. Therefore, I will summarize which implicit or explicit claims or political statements are made by the authors, and in which ways these statements relate to the positions of respective authors as well as academia in general. Further, I would like to contrast the academic discourse concerning issues related to secularism in Bangladesh to the emerging scholarship that discusses ways of conceptualizing non-religion and secularism. Consequently, I will use a few selected approaches to argue that a conversation between both so far largely disconnected corpuses of scholarship can be of mutual benefit as it allows a critical review of the existing narratives and debates in both of them. I will conclude my presentation with proposing possible approaches that will allow us a deeper understanding of the politics of secularism in Bangladesh.

She thoroughly documents the role of freethinkers in France that follows the work of Albert Bayet and Pierre Leveque. However, Lalouette, Bayet, and Leveque give a limited analysis of the reasons for the rupture with the Church. Lalouette briefly notes that freethinkers were born into freethought families, revolted intellectually, or morally rejected the idea of God (such as after experiencing the horrors of World War One). Studying the deconversion testimonies of the évadés and freethinkers puts their voice back into the historical record. They believed they were living through a great spiritual crisis and transition. The Church could have found a way to embrace change. Instead, the Catholic hierarchy resisted reform, pushing many believers into a tenuous spirituality or unbelief and direct cultural conflict."
Being areligious in Antiquity – Individual Dimensions of Disbelief,Nicole Hartmann,Humboldt-University of Berlin,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Studies on Antiquity are mostly stuck in their dependence on literary sources. Philosophical, antiquarian, judicial or theological reflections, tragic, satirical, polemical or apologetic texts were mostly produced by 'organizational men' (Jörg Rüpke). They set the agenda of proper behaviour, norms and practices and, what they consider to be deviant. They create the dichotomy of 'religion' and 'atheism'. „Battling the Gods. Atheism in the Ancient World“ (2015) by Tim Whitmarsh is just the latest example of how difficult it is for scholars to look beyond these dominating discourses. The project I am thinking about aims at individual aspects of disbelief and personal reasons for denying to participate in rituals and cults or merely being indifferent towards 'religion'. So far my approach is informed by the 'Lived Ancient Religion' concept of the ERC funded Research Group at the Max Weber Kolleg Erfurt and the theoretical framework of the 'Multiple Secularities' project at the University of Leipzig. The biggest methodological challenge will be the quest for sources and testimonies, since there are no ego-documents of 'confessing' sceptics or atheists. One has to analyze indirect sources as, for example, leges sacrae and will meet a lot of difficulties to distinguish wilful disregard from unintentional transgression etc. Nonetheless, in my point of view, it is about time to conceptualize these individual dimensions of non-religion for the ancient world (namely in the time and space of the Roman Empire) and ask about the dynamics it set free in groups responses.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

I make this argument by reflecting on the sermon that Giorgio Agamben gave in Notre Dame Cathedral in March 2009. The argument has three main components: 1) the church is understood to be a community of foreigners and exiles as opposed to citizens of a city, state, kingdom or empire; 2) the church is marked by a distinctive relation to time which is in tension with the chronological timeframe of a particular socio-political construct of law or state, in our case Western neo-liberal representative democracy; 3) the way that community can form and flourish is in an extraordinary kind of tension between the poles presented in the first two points, namely aliens and citizens and chronological and eschatological time. Taking these components in order, I will look at several characteristics from the genealogy of Western European Secularity that can help provide for this ecclesial recovery. I will then suggest that there can be a positive tension between secularity and a Jesus style of church, and that this can engender a flourishing community for all. I will then refer to the current refugee crisis as a context for this."

This blog has focused on a limited set of US-based surveys, but similar effects have been found elsewhere. What this work shows is that scholars interested in studying nonreligious and nonbelieving individuals need to recognize that how questions are framed will influence the results they get. There are many ways to ask about religious belonging and believing, and most of these aren’t intrinsically wrong or right – so long as the data are analysed and interpreted in a way that is sensitive to what the question is doing. On the other hand, some questions are very, very wrong, and scholars should be at pains to avoid them."

Thus I call for consideration of the post-secular paradigm which can accommodate and speak to the variety of religious and non-religious positions. Without doubt, this line of inquiry has been apparent in disciplines such as Anthropology and Sociology for decades and more, yet the disciplines of Politics and International Relations (PIR) have remained resistant to the reality of public religion specifically because it challenges the public/private divide which rests at the center of dominant PIR theories."

They preferred terms such as emotional connectedness, awe, or beauty, which are commonly included in definitions of spirituality. For a few individuals, spirituality referred to the existence of spirits. A minority in the study (12%) had what might be defined as 'other worldly experiences,’ although these were explained in purely naturalistic terms (e.g., lack of sleep, drugs/alcohol, and brain dysfunction).

I also argue that hiloni cultivation of reasonableness is an emotio-political outcome of a long-standing and unresolved ideological problem within Zionist thought. Reasonableness is not simply an emotional practice of self-cultivation but has also – indirectly and often unintentionally – facilitated and rendered opaque practices of Israeli state sovereignty over many aspects of Palestinian life.

Grassroots Atheism and the Atheist Movement,Stephen LeDrew,Uppsala University,Sweden,M,Evelina Lundmark,Uppsala University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this research we examine research done on the (at the time) unmoderated and hugely popular online atheist forum – reddit.com/r/atheism – in relation to the ideology new atheism and the atheist movement in North America. The study on /r/atheism was a qualitative study conducted in early 2013, which traced discursive practices on an online space with no official ties to atheist or humanist organizations. The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the 'practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory. Our cooperation has thus impelled us to ask questions regarding the use and construction of atheism in our respective work, as well as questions on which scientific research inform our different choices, and how this is reflected in the write up process.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

As a social media site, YouTube particularly has played an important role in the visibility of atheism, providing a platform for atheists to challenge religious dogma. This has been particularly true for the American context, where many of the YouTube atheists I have research are located. In America, atheism is still viewed with suspicion, and consistently one of the most distrusted minorities. Particularly in places like the deep southern states, identifying as an atheist remains problematic. YouTube, however, has facilitated 'coming out’ as an atheist, a topic that has been of interest to researchers in the sociology of religion. My research has shown that religious discussions and arguments cannot be divorced from the social context in which they take place. This has grown increasingly more complicated with the development of new mobile technology and the integration of offline and online lives. My research now looks at the ways in which 'context collapse’ (or the diverse audiences watching users on social media from a variety of different, disparate backgrounds) has affected how users present themselves and their beliefs or lack of beliefs online. In 2006, many users couldn’t say they were atheists in offline settings, but could do so on YouTube; now, it’s potentially much easier to declare a lack of faith, but users have a growing awareness of all the different people watching them."
Politics and Religion in Contemporary Turkey: Perspectives of Atheists,Tayfun Kasapoglu,Vytautas Magnus University,Lithuania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a society where religion is very present in public life, conducting research on atheists itself may become an act of contestation, especially if atheists constitute a small minority and are perceived as deviant in the society. In my on-going qualitative research on self-identified atheists in contemporary Turkey, I aim to investigate atheists’ perceptions on relations between politics and religion, as well as to understand how this relationship affects atheists’ personal experiences in society. As a part of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with atheists from different backgrounds in Turkey. In these interviews, atheists based their perspectives on personal experiences and did not strictly differentiate between religious and nonreligious. The informants often perceived current politics and religion as closely linked to each other and underlined an increasing religiosity and polarization in society drawing on examples related to media, gender, politics and education. While there were significant differences between opinions of atheists from religious and secular families, almost all the informants regarded religion as an expansionist power that is becoming more visible in every area of social life with the policies imposed by the current right-wing government. They recommended limiting religion to the private sphere and thus creating secular spaces in which not only religious Muslims but everyone could thrive.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

Elsewhere online, the boundary between religion and nonreligion becomes much harder to trace. If we only pay attention to the most explicit forms of anti-religion, we risk missing some of the more subtle and interesting negotiations of what it actually means to be (or not to be) “religious”. We can also miss whole areas of activity in which the boundary doesn’t seem to mean very much at all. As Dusty Hoesly argues in a recent article in Secularism and Nonreligion, 'religious, spiritual, secular, and nonreligious identities are not stable, unitary formations’, but performances, 'discursive, relational constructions contingently articulated in particular locations at specific times for particular purposes’. Researchers interested in digital nonreligion need to look out for those performances, and to develop methodologies that are sensitive to their transient contexts and implications."
The Christmas bear: merry reflections on the sacred in a secular Christmas,Timothy Stacey,Goldsmiths College,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Timothy Stacey reflects on secular spirits of giving in this festive period… ",2016,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Standing in the urinals of a pub in Bangalore, India, I look up to see a Christmas-themed poster. A bear, wearing a Christmas hat, invites me to “get merry this Christmas – and not just on our beer”. I was about to dismiss the poster as a depressing example of the needless secularization and commercialisation of Christmas. Though barely raised Christian, I suppose I had always assumed that Christian symbols such as, say, the nativity scene, still reminded what we might call post-Christian (raised Christian and still influenced by Christian culture despite neither believing nor attending church) celebrants that Christmas was about remembering the poor. I was about to dismiss the poster, but realising I had nothing better to do, decided to read on. In fact, the Christmas bear invited me to get merry by gifting money to a poor child. I had been too quick to judge. Later, I saw how those taking up the offer had been incorporated into a public ritual,immortalized by writing their name beside a picture of the child they had helped on a paper tag, which had been draped in the branches of a Christmas tree, where normally decorative baubles might hang. I reflected on how a secular Christmas had nonetheless sacralized and ritualised giving and receiving, and this ritual in itself might be a strong enough anchor from which to inspire solidarity with the poor."
The Varieties of Personal Orientations to Religion: Dynamics of Religious and Nonreligious Positions in Self-Narratives of Well-Educated Young Adults in the Netherlands,Ulrike Popp-Baier,University of Amsterdam,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Self-narratives are well-known resources from which to analyze the subtleties of people’s orientations toward “religion“. They provide the necessary biographical context for addressing individual religiousness in the context of personal concerns, experiences and orientations, thus stressing the diversity and varieties of people’s religious orientations and experiences which are embedded in processes of interpretation and reflection related to activities and events in daily life, and evolving and changing in the course of a lifetime. “Religious” or “nonreligious” people are often not only addressing, adopting, or contesting various contents of belief in plural religious contexts, but also demonstrating various “modes of belief or unbelief ” such as being convinced, trusting, hoping, assuming, preferring, doubting, pondering, denying etc. When we consider these varieties, clear-cut distinctions between “being religious” and “being nonreligious” will often disappear. The main research question in our current project is: What types of religiousness are discernable among well-educated adults in the Netherlands ? We started our empirical research with a preliminary exploratory study which is still ongoing. Until yet 20 selfnarratives (gained by a combination of biographical-narrative interviews with semi-structured interviews) of students at polytechnic institutes of higher learning in the Netherlands have been gathered. The purposive sample aims at maximal variation among self-ascribed religiousness, spirituality, nonreligiousness and non-spirituality. Thus far Catholics and former Catholics, Protestants and former Protestants, Muslims, people affiliated with the socalled holistic milieu and people with no religious affiliation or interest in spirituality at all have been included into the sample. Besides different constellations of religiousness, nonreligiousness, spirituality and “non-spirituality”, a thematic coding analysis of the 20 interviewtranscripts also revealed two common patterns in the interviews thus far: a moral orientation to life and variations of a just-world belief (Lerner, 1980). This paper will elaborate on the different constellations and on the common patterns as well. Conceptual and methodological consequences for a psychological study of “nonreligiousness” will be discussed.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

This is a technology which influences neurons in the brain through either focused magnetic fields (such as in transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS for short) or a weak electrical current emitted by electrodes placed on the skull (transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS for short). TMS can induce or impede action potentials in neurons, thus stimulating or inhibiting brain regions, while tDCS modulates the neuronal excitability of the target area – this can be positive, when the neuronal excitability is increased, or negative, when the neuronal excitability is decreased. Together these studies suggest that neuromodulation can induce changes in beliefs. The majority of the studies used TMS, and in particular inhibitory TMS. A number of questions remain, and they point to questions of significance for the study of 'unbelieving’ as well as religious and spiritual forms of believing: How long lasting and powerful are the effects of neuromodulation on belief, and what does this tell us about the stability of belief and unbelief between contexts and over time? Can neuromodulation turn an atheist into a devout believer – or a religious individual into an ardent atheist? Or do articulate forms of 'positive atheism’ also provide opportunities for self-transcendence so that some forms of unbelief behave similarly to religious and spiritual belief? What brain regions need to be targeted to achieve these changes, and what does this tell us about the nature of belief and unbelief? Can tDCS, a more affordable method of neuromodulation, induce the same effects as TMS in studies on belief?"

Answers reflect both actual beliefs and also tendencies to consciously or unconsciously give the “right” (nice, friendly, socially acceptable) answer. One school of thought says that we should turn away from self-reports and try to develop implicit measures of cognition. Another school of thought says that we can still ask people about their beliefs, but we should do so in a way that gives people an “out,” by which they can tell us about their beliefs in an indirect way, with pressures to appear socially desirable somewhat mitigated."
Methodological challenges in conducting research on irreligious Tunisians,Yosr Ben Slima,King's College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will examine the methodological difficulties related to the study of the nonreligion phenomenon within Tunisia (a Muslim-majority country). I argue that the problem stems from the difficulty of defining and locating nonreligion, especially in the absence of any forms of organization. Certain material manifestations of nonreligion can be signs of unorthodox Islam rather than material signs of nonreligion ,while abidance by some Islamic rituals is not necessarily a sign of piety and belief. I propose the neologism 'practicing irreligious Tunisians’ to refer to irreligious individuals who consciously choose to continue performing Islamic rituals. Abiding by certain Islamic rituals has become for these irreligious Tunisians living with traditional Muslim families, a manner to develop more empathy, by refusing to inflict pain on their beloved ones. This moral consideration is shaped by what these irreligious Tunisians refer to as 'humane values’ or in a more ironic manner ' ethics of Kofar’2 . The methodological challenge resides in distinguising between unorthodoxy and nonreligion .Who is a real irreligious Tunisian ? To understand the subversive nature of the irreligious performance of Islamic rituals , I rely on the virtual sphere which presents an outlet used by many irreligious Tunisians to express their 'authentic selves’. I combine both virtual ethnography and long-term relationships with irreligious Tunisians to explore nonreligion in a context where the fear of social rejection and the ambivalence of the legal system vis-à-vis nonreligious Tunisians make it difficult to openly approach the subject in the public sphere.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.,.

First, we show no consistent relationships between religion or nonreligion and chronic condition prevalence. Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i.e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing intersectional approaches to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.

In this post, Alexandros Sakellariou explores this question by examining Greek atheists. His analysis shows that Greek atheists choose to be atheists as a result of breaking the chains of religious memory. At first, formation of their atheist identity is largely to reject their Orthodox identity, but Greek atheists gradually find their own positive identity with atheist beliefs and morality.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The outcome of my research is that Greek atheists having brought up as Greek Orthodox Christians decided to break this chain of religious memory and change their ethnic nominal Orthodox identity at some point of their life course following a variety of paths. However, as it came out, after an initial stage of rejecting their Orthodox identity they gave moved towards a positive formation of an atheist identity. This means that the vast majority of them reflected on a number of issues, particularly life meaning and morality, building this way a distinct atheist identity which is not any more identified exclusively with anti-Orthodox attitudes. It is not easy to argue whether there are more atheists in Greece now, or that they have started to speak out, or both. The truth is that atheism in Greece is still in its infancy compared with other western societies and which also applies to its scientific study."
Has God Really Returned to Eastern Europe?,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A recent Washington Times editorial proclaimed “God Returns to Eastern Europe”.

The message is simple: godless Commies failed and religion is back, prospering again much as it did a hundred years ago. At first glance, the data presented in the article seems to support this understanding: 86% of Russians ascribe to some variant of religious belief and 44% of Russians claim to be “quite religious”. Moreover, the percentage of atheists has dropped by half from 26 to 13% in last three years. While it is definitely true that religion in post-Soviet society is in a much better position than during the project of “forced secularization” (Froese 2004), the author(s) of the editorial may have got some things wrong and missed some important points. First of all, although the editorial claims to rely on Pew study, some of the data seem to originate from Levada Center’s (Russian counterpart of the Pew Research Center) recent survey on religiosity in Russia (report in Russian), mediated to Anglophone readers by Breitbart News – during which some things have been clearly lost in translation. For instance, looking at the original Levada report, 44% of “quite religious” Russians turn out to be “somewhat religious” and only 9% describe themselves as “very religious”. In sum, only about half of the population considers themselves more or less “religious”. Regarding the diminishing percentage of atheists, Levada data actually indicate a noticeable change (which instantly arises suspicion) among those, who said they are “totally irreligious”."
The Sacred Structure of Doubt: Reflections on Christ-Haunted Atheism,Ben Wood,University of Chester,Wales,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ben Wood considers the ways in which our Western secular culture is still 'haunted’ by the Christian story. And like an unruly ghost, this narrative presence refuses to rest, producing the peculiar contradiction of faithful unbelief– in art, philosophy, and literature.  Yet, in the midst of this cultural paradox, there exists a stirring coherence.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Contemporary discussions of religious belief in the media are frequently conducted through the unaccommodating lenses of binary thinking. Either we either 'believe in God’ or we disbelieve. A religious story either makes sense to us or else we are baffled. What is perhaps less talked about however, are the so-called marginal cases where unbelief owes its structure and vitality to faith. So obsessed is our culture with 'the fundamentalist’ and the 'true believer’ that we rarely consider the religious life of the doubter. Such oversight is examined with verve and colour in Simon Critchley’s book Faith of the Faithless. Here the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde is described as one living a religiously ambiguous life. Neither straightforwardly Christian nor flatly apostate, Wilde’s sense of the sacred is continually mediated through the beauties of art, iconography and scripture. Such an aesthetic sensibility is forever slippery, neither rejecting Christianity nor fully embracing it. As Critchley suggests, this is 'the faith of the faithless and the belief of unbelievers, a faith which does not give up the idea of truth, but reinterprets it.’"

While a spoof in some respects, the followers point out that nothing is inherently sacred and that sacredness is simply whatever a group of people choose to deem sacred. Religion has traditionally been centered on belief in a powerful supernatural being which is turned to by believers for answers to difficult questions about the purpose of life and for support and good fortune in major endeavors, such as war. However, Christianity has been on the wane for decades in the U.S. and Europe. Theologian John Shelby Spong has challenged Christians, in order to revive their faith, to redefine God in non-theistic terms, not as a human-like being but as an abstract concept around which to focus one’s life."

Albania was funded as a multi-religious country. The political elites considered religion, particularly Islam, an impediment to national unity and progress. The inhabitants were urged to ignore religious differences, and the first Constitution (1922) established that 'the state does not have any official religion’. In 1990, the last year of communist rule, religion was legalised. A myriad of Muslim and Christian traditions resurfaced, and Albanians of different religious persuasions celebrated their newborn freedom. Surveys indicate that secularism, religious freedom and equality have strong popular support. The statistics give us an idea about sociological aspects, but say less about “lived religion” and individualised systems of meaning. "

In this blog, Cees Tulp details explorative research that offers an empirical instrument to measure hope – 'the Hope Barometer’.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"This project entails explorative research to hope from different disciplines to gain conceptual clarity. Because hope is as complex and ambiguous as the human person himself or herself, it requires interdisciplinary investigation. The aim of the project is first to gain a better understanding of the concept of hope, but furthermore to stimulate a cross-disciplinary dialogue about hope. One of the stimuli has been an academic conference entitled “Driven by Hope: Economics and Theology in Dialogue,” which took place in February 2017 at the Evangelical Theological Faculty in Leuven. The second phase of the project seeks to give more insight into the empirical relation between hope and happiness. Besides literature study, an empirical instrument to measure hope has been developed called the Hope Barometer. It is the most complete instrument developed until now to measure hope. In contrast to other instruments to measure hope, the Hope Barometer distinguishes seven different dimensions of hope (thought, emotion, virtue, social hope, economic expectation, institutional trust and spiritual hope)."

Evan finds that belief in evolution and education are not significant predictors of atheist identification when we control for political views.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Last year I published a review article laying out some of the challenges for studying atheism, particularly in the United States. We know that anti-atheist sentiment in the U.S. is persistent and durable, and that atheists do a lot of collective work to build a common sense of identity. As a result, my work argues that we have to carefully distinguish non-belief in god from atheist self-identification, since self-identification signals far more than non-belief alone. Choosing to call oneself an atheist in the United States means navigating stigma, community affinities, and relationships to authority, and it can therefore become a shortcut for a range of assumptions about matters of public concern. I used survey data to investigate the differences between non-belief and atheist self-identification, but the original analysis from the review article was not conclusive. Most surveys, even those that can measure (non)religion in detail, cannot get a large enough subsample of atheists to make strong claims. The study of nonreligion is developing into a robust field, drawing interest from across the social sciences and humanities. As it continues to grow, researchers who work in this area will continue to face questions about whether their findings are generalizable across different groups and whether they replicate in different social contexts. Luckily, new data have become publicly available that allow for a conceptual replication."

Yet this view places religion and secularism into a binary relationship with each other, despite the scholarly efforts to demonstrate that this binary is the result of a particular Christian cultural-historical trajectory. The religion/secular binary is subsequently reflected in a series of related modern binaries, such as religion/politics; private/public, which are primarily ideological rather than having a basis in lived experience. The lived experience of Bengali Muslims revolves around dharma, a vernacular category that pushes through a religious/secular binary. My ethnographic exploration of Bengali Muslims’ understanding of dharma therefore provokes an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between religion, secularism and politics."

As a rebellious theologian, I take that title to be literally true. But despite the implication, Woodhead was not theorising 'no religion’ as religion. What struck me about the disjunction between my conclusion about no religion and Woodhead’s hiatus, was that the title presages a potential conceptual advance that remains something of an obstacle because we have not quite completed the conceptual armoury needed to get round it; but that such an advance would be fertile in connecting up the wave of empirical studies of the non-religious, such as Woodhead, Lois Lee and many others have been engaging, with new work theorising the nonreligious. To summarize the result of this theorising, the category 'no religion’ for me comprises a raft of world-building, life-meaning-making endeavours, within the framework of a naturalistic worldview, that are sociologically indistinguishable from the world-building, life-orientating endeavours carried out within the framework of a theistic worldview. Therefore, I see in 'non-religion’ a spectrum of new naturalistic religions."

However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995–2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions. Based on previous literature and the empirical evidence presented in this study, we argue that overall lower levels of institutional confidence among secular Americans is an outcome of the exclusion of such individuals from American social life.

I plea for collecting and analyzing manifestations of the secular, as the secular as an phenomenon in society is surprisingly unexplored. To stimulate such inquiry, I suggest a material approach to the secular, as it will provide researchers with tools to conduct empirical research on the secular in contemporary societies. Inspired by Joan Scott, Charles Hirschkind, and Talal Asad, this article explores the notion of a Dutch 'sexular’ body: a body which affective-gestural repertoires, limited here to the context of sexuality, people in society (historically) associate with the secular. I conclude by arguing that a material approach to the secular will contribute to (1) obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the secular, including its cultural conceptualizations and manifestations, and (2) clarifying, and hence facing the normativity the secular imposes on the people living in secular societies.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.,.

Below, he charts some of the most provocative questions coming out of those sessions, whose as-yet-unknown answers might steer where our knowledge of Canadian nones goes next.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"This monograph is based on face-to-face interviews with three groups of Canadians: 30 active religious affiliates (identify with a Christian group and attend religious services nearly every week), 30 marginal religious affiliates (identify with a Christian group and attend religious services mainly for religious holidays and rites of passage), and 30 religious nones (do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services). Contrary to rational choice theorists who contend that there is ongoing demand for the things that religious groups offer (e.g. meaning and purpose in life, life after death), I question the assumption that if we simply adjust religious supply (e.g. better music or preaching, more programming, or more liberal theology) we should expect increased involvement in institutionalized forms of religious life. Further, I develop how and why I think secularization theory remains useful for describing and explaining religious belief and practice in Canada."
Whither the Paranormal in Secular Studies?,Joseph O. Baker,East Tennessee State University,Tennessee,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Joseph O. Baker encourages the study of nonreligion to look beyond the study of atheists and skeptics, and explore what he calls the doubly castoff, the supernatural.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"In our rush to study secularities empirically, we have made great progress on examining topics such as atheism, particularly in terms of ideology and social movements, as organized communities, patterns of psychological dispositions, and more generally as a culturally constructed yet socially relevant category. Considering how little research there was of this kind a decade ago, these are indeed encouraging signs of vitality.  But other dimensions within the broader umbrella of “nonreligion” have gone unexplored. For example, despite an expanded understanding of the social psychologies of supernatural disbelief, spirits still haunt secular studies just out of sight (or off the page), much as they do religious studies and the social sciences more generally—particularly psychology.  That is to say, secular studies is in no way alone in ignoring—or in the case of organized skeptic groups, condemning—the paranormal.  Indeed, the paranormal is, by definition, the doubly damned castoff of both organized religions and secular scientism. Yet damnation doesn’t make the paranormal go away.  It always returns."
Belonging Without Believing?,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"New research reports that 53% of the British public now describe themselves as having “no religion”. In this media response blog, Josh Bullock comments on his research on the Sunday Assembly London in this post-Christian transition.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Generational Y (born after 1980 and sometimes referred to as 'Millennials’) trends towards nonreligion in the UK have allowed the Sunday Assembly — a secular community that uses existing religious structures, rituals and practices — to flourish. It is through this post-Christian transition and religion as a chain of memory that people are still seeking to belong, but do not wish to believe in a religious doctrine. It is this current transitional phase that has provided the correct conditions for the Sunday Assembly to take flight as an idea and global congregational movement. Clichéd as it may sound, the world was not ready for the Sunday Assembly even as recent as 25 years ago — simply put, it would not have served a purpose or fulfilled a niche. However, with the dawn of the new millennium, then post-9/11, post-new-atheism, and the decline of Christianity in the UK, the Sunday Assembly could thrive as a 'half-way house’ for those leaving their religion and those who had never been religious, but who sought what religious communities had to exclusively offer. What becomes apparent is a need to not completely cast out Christianity and its rituals and traditions."
The 'Nones’ and the Australian Census,Kevin Lenehan,University of Divinity,Australia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the await for the Australian Census result coming out in mid-2017, Kevin Lenehan reflects on demographics of Australian 'nones’ from 1971 to date. He demonstrates that inconsistency and complexity of the question of 'nones’ result in confusion over how to best describe these people and interpret their expression of unbelief, anticipating the upcoming Census report will bring us new insights.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Since 1911, the Census has provided current information on religious identification in Australia. Since 1933, it has been optional to identify a religious affiliation, and in 1971 those with no religious affiliation were instructed 'if no religion, write none’, resulting in a seven-fold increase on previous figures for no religion. The number of Australians reporting no religion has continued to rise steadily at about 3.9 percentage points per decade; the decade between 2001 and 2011 saw the largest increase at 6.8 percentage points. In 2011, 22% of Australians (just under 4.8 million people) chose the 'no religion’ option."
Expanding on the Experiences of Transgender Nonreligious People: An Exploratory Analysis,Lain A. B. Mathers,University of Illinois at Chicago,Illinois,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Building on research that points out the specific forms of marginalization that transgender and nonreligious people face in contemporary U.S. society, this exploratory analysis focuses on the experiences of transgender nonreligious people who were raised in religious households. Utilizing interviews with eleven formerly religious, now nonreligious, transgender people I draw out some of the future pathways scholars of nonreligion should take to better account for the lives of transgender nonreligious people in scholarship on nonreligion. Specifically, scholars of nonreligion should begin analyzing transgender nonreligious people’s experiences in religious settings, with family, and with organizations and networks outside of religion. I conclude by discussing the ways this study can shed light on the broader processes by which inequality is reproduced and make suggestions for nonreligious leaders to make room for and listen to transgender people in nonreligious spaces.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.
Secular Weddings in Canada: An Examination of a Humanist Response to the Evolution of Marriage,Lloyd Hawkeye Robertson,Athabasca University,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite increasing societal secularization, little research has been undertaken on the needs of non-religious people to engage in marriage ceremony or the means by which such needs are met. Using a jurisdictional scan, focus groups, and an on-line survey, this exploratory survey examines the provision for and use of secular legal marriage in Canada’s regions from a humanist perspective. It is postulated that marriage ceremonies have persisted among the non-religious due to needs to authenticate or recognize transitional changes to the self, but these needs have been met through ad hoc strategies as opposed to a uniform demand for humanist services. Implications for humanist organizations are discussed along with recommendations for further research.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.,.
Reframing Assisted Dying: Nonreligion and the Law,Lori Beaman,University of Ottawa,Canada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Law and religion frequently interact, sometimes as a matter of challenging religion’s reach into public spaces, sometimes as a matter of reentrenching majority religion. But what about nonreligion and the law? In this piece, Lori G. Beaman argues that subtle shifts in legal approaches can be revealing of the often mysterious contents of nonreligion. Specifically, she asks: what could a nonreligious approach to assisted dying law look like?",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"There are two challenges that are preoccupying me in my research on nonreligion: first, how to think about nonreligion without being pulled into the “like religion but…” vortex and second, how to study this emerging reality. One such site is in law. This is especially so on the issue of assisted death. The Supreme Court of Canada permits interveners to make submissions when it is hearing a case of public importance. In Carter there were 26 interveners, 12 of them religious. One of those was in favour of the idea of establishing an assisted dying regime. The rest were opposed. They used language like “suicide” and used the word “death” rather than “dying”, while nonreligious interveners used terms such as “end-of-life decisions”; “assisted dying”; “medically assisted dying”; “self-chosen death”. Nonreligious interveners framed their understanding of dying as including the possibility of a “good death”, which respected the wishes of the individual and preserved dignity. The point here is that the facta reveal distinctly different approaches that illuminate what we might describe as a nonreligious approach to this issue, or, the dark matter of nonreligion, to return to that metaphor."
Why we care: Searching for secular spirituality in British hospitals,Madeleine Parkes,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Based on her work as a non-religious healthcare chaplain, Madeleine Parkes discusses the role and purpose of spirituality in healthcare. ",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Since its inception in 1948, the NHS healthcare system in Britain has funded the provision of chaplains, or professional spiritual care givers, in part to ensure patient’s rights under the Human Rights Act (Article 9) and the 2006 Equality Act are met. The NHS is also interested in how a patient’s spirituality is helpful to healing and wellbeing. As a non-religious healthcare chaplain myself whose main responsibility is the provision of spiritual care to non-religious patients, I have faced some challenges when discussing and implementing secular spiritual care in a hospital environment. In the recent blog, Watts argues that scholars of spirituality must make a distinction between the study for spirituality (understanding spirituality’s practical application) and the study of spirituality (describing spirituality in a specific context). One of the challenges I face as a non-religious chaplain is managing both of these approaches to studying spirituality in a secular and medical based institution."
Translating a 'Religion’, Translating a 'Culture’: A 'Non-Religious’ Expression of a Japanese Religion in France,Masato Kato,SOAS University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Masato Kato presents an analysis of what he calls a 'non-religious’ expression of a Japanese religion that has been operating in France since the 1970s. He explores how the translation of a 'religious tradition’ into a 'culture’ has been perceived in the changing cultural and socio-political conditions in French society.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"Can religious traditions be explained non-religiously? A religious group often attempts to present their traditions as culture in order to increase their visibility and gain legitimacy in the sense of 'social acceptance’ in the public. A group known as Tenrikyō has sought to present itself in French society by translating the image of the little known religious tradition into widely appreciated representations associated with Japan. In the operation of translation, Tenrikyō has faced with not only cultural and linguistic challenges but also been caught up in the socio-political condition, being swayed by how society defines and perceives what 'religious’ activities are."
Beyond 'Religion versus Emancipation’. Formulating Methodological Considerations about 'the Secular’ in Public Controversies.,Nella van den Brandt,Utrecht University,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this post, Nella van den Brandt introduces the 2016-2021 project “Beyond 'Religion versus Emancipation’: Gender and Sexuality in Women’s Conversions to Judaism, Christianity and Islam in Contemporary Western Europe”, hosted at the Philosophy and Religious Studies Department of Utrecht University, the Netherlands. She argues that, by examining controversial events, her project sheds new light for understanding of how secularity shapes and is shaped by public discourse.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"My subproject, 'Contemporary Controversies about Religion and Women’s Emancipation in Western-European Contexts: Great Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium’, started in September 2016. It will select and analyse contemporary controversial cases from public debates about religion, gender and sexuality. Of central importance to this project is the assumption that public debates predominantly constitute secular discourses about religion, gender and sexuality that emphasise women’s equality and sexual freedom. An analysis of controversies in public debates, therefore, reveals secular normative understandings about women’s emancipation and the presuppositions underlying them. A second assumption is that these understandings about women’s emancipation are constituted partly through scrutinising and critiquing the norms, positions and roles laid out for women in monotheistic religious traditions and communities. Secular normative statements about women’s equality and emancipation can, therefore, be studied as 'identity markers’ over and against religious communities. By studying current controversies in public debates, the project aims to clarify secular discourses which women converting to different religious traditions in West-European contexts have to negotiate."
Science and religion conflict for non-religious Britons and Canadians,Rebecca Catto,Kent State University,Ohio,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Rebecca Catto introduces new project findings from social scientific research conducted in Canada and the UK. She highlights the tendency of non-religious publics and life scientists in both countries to see science and religion as conflicting.",2017,Blog,NSRN blog,.,.,"The “conflict thesis” is the label historians of science give to the purported essential and enduring incompatibility or clash between science and religion. However, today this thesis is considered historically inaccurate. So, why then does it persist? This gap between narratives, perceptions, and knowledge was part of the motivation for the current Science and Religion: Exploring the Spectrum project. Given that the US is already the most researched country and a distinctively polarized one in terms of science and religion debates, we chose to focus upon two cognate and yet contrasting national contexts: Canada and the UK. The multidisciplinary, multi-sited team has been conducting qualitative sociological, historical, psychological, and survey research in both countries. We also decided to concentrate upon the relationship between evolution and religion, because this has become a focal point for wider science and religion debates."
No One Expects a Transgender Jew: Religious, Sexual and Gendered Intersections in the Evaluation of Religious and Nonreligious Others,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,Jason Edward Sumerau,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While a large body of research has established that there is substantial prejudice against atheists and nonreligious individuals, both in the US and in other countries where nonreligious people are minorities, to date very little research has looked beyond attitudes toward solitary identities (e.g., “atheists” vs. “gay atheists”). Given the growing recognition of the importance of intersectionality in understanding the experiences of minorities, in this article we examined attitudes toward intersected identities, combining five (non)religious identities (i.e., Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, and nonreligious) with four sexual/gender identities (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender) using a 100-point thermometer scale (N = 618). We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were religious identities, with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non)religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” religious identities, unless those religious identities are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.
Organized Secularism in the United States: New Directions in Research,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,Christel Manning,Sacred Heart University,Connecticut,F,Lori L. Fazzino,University of Nevada,Nevada,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"There has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of the US population that is not religious. However, there is, to date, very little research on the social movement that is organizing to serve the needs of and advocate for the nonreligious in the US. This is a book about the rise and structure of organized secularism in the United States. By organized secularism we mean the efforts of nonreligious individuals to build institutions, networks, and ultimately a movement that serves their interests in a predominantly religious society. Researchers from various fields address questions such as: What secularist organizations exist? Who are the members of these organizations? What kinds of organizations do they create? What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past? And what is their likely impact on the future of secularism? For anyone trying to understand the rise of the nonreligious in the US, this book will provide valuable insights into organized efforts to normalize their worldview and advocate for their equal treatment in society.",2017,Book,"Religion and its others: Studies in Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity",.,.,.
Straight Gods, White Devils: Exploring Paths to Non-Religion in the Lives of Black LGBTQ People,Simone Kolysh,The Graduate Center,New York,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"To examine paths to non-religion in the lives of black LGBTQ people, I analyze 10 interviews of black LGBTQ people who were raised Christian. Utilizing an intersectional lens, I conclude that lessons of the Christian home, reinforced in religious school and at church, drew a connection between Christianity, one’s racial and ethnic identity, and heterosexuality in such a way that being LGBTQ was marked un-Christian and foreign, and sometimes associated with whiteness. This further shaped how my participants navigated the urban public sphere, one of the only spheres where they could 'be LGBTQ’ – some neighborhoods were constructed as Christian, connected to one’s childhood and hostile to LGBTQ people, while others were LGBTQ-friendly, albeit largely white and gentrified. The overall impact of Christianity across multiple spheres influenced which non-religious paths my participants took. One remained with a Christian denomination of her childhood and one remained with a Christian denomination of her mother but not her father. The other eight left Christianity behind, with one choosing a different religion and seven becoming non-religious, holding identities from Unitarian Universalist to atheist. Overall, black LGBTQ people struggle to find acceptance of their LGBTQ identities by people closest to them and acceptance of their racial, ethnic and non-religious identities in largely white and often non-religious LGBTQ spaces. In response, they use different strategies to find community and live coherent lives, whenever possible.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power,.

Their Christian counterparts paint themselves as a minority under attack: their symbols mocked, repressed or castigated in the name of nonchalance, diversity, commercialisation. This has reached the point that many of us get anxious even discussing the holiday with colleagues: “what are you doing for…Christmas? Winter break? Help!” But what are the thoughts of the silent majority? For the first time in history, religious “nones” are now the dominant group in the UK and Australia, and a close second in the US and Canada. How do they feel about Christmas? How do they navigate the complex mesh of Christian, secular and commercial symbols?"
