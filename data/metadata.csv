Supernatural agency detection in random visual noise,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Within the cognitive science of religion it has been suggested that belief in supernatural agents is ubiquitous because of its capacity to fit the human cognitive system. Specifically, Barrett (2004) has suggested that a hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD), alongside other cognitive tools such as Theory of Mind, mediates this belief. Due to the hypersensitivity of the agency detection device, it is prone to find agents in the environment, even when none are present. Why some individuals do not believe in supernatural agency despite presumably still having a HADD has, however, previously gone untested. The task set was to detect (1) when the stimulus was a degraded image, and (2) what the image was (free response). Data from these tasks provide information on controlled and automatic dispositional factors at work during agency detection. Preliminary results suggest that there is a significant difference in the types of agency and non-agency detected within the random stimuli. This was across the participant groups, however, and there was no significant difference between the two belief-groups regarding the frequency with which agency was detected. Significant differences between the two participant groups were found, however, when analysing levels of psychoticism, boundaries and empathy, highlighting potential confounding variables that may interfere with the study of agency detection in religious and non-religious participants.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.

This approach was the first in the sociology of Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives religion to research belief by asking non-religious questions of apparently non-religious people.

Belief in science and in the “Da Vinci Code”: Measuring naturalistic beliefs and its cognitive correlates,Miguel Farias,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper describes the development of a scale of naturalistic beliefs by the author of the paper, in collaboration with philosophers Guy Kahane and Nick Shackle, and the historian of science John Hedley Brooke. Preliminary validation of the scale was carried out with a sample of religious and atheist students (N = 130), that also filled in a number of other measures, including belief in ideas put forward in the best-selling ―Da Vinci Code‖ novel, knowledge of the Bible, and standardised cognitive and personality scales. I will present and discuss the newly developed scale on naturalistic beliefs as a way of tapping into contemporary atheists‘ ideas and attitudes, particularly related to the value attributed to science in understanding the world. I will also discuss some apparently contradictory evidence suggesting that atheists have higher scores both on ―need for cognition‖ and ―Da Vinci Code beliefs‖ than religious people.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
Dimensions and types of non-religiosity: Scale development in progress,Nicholas Gibson,University of Cambridge,England,M,Claire White,University of Oxford,England,F,Kirsten Barnes,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"We are unaware of any scale or instrument that can be used to distinguish among types of non-religious individuals. Although various labels exist to describe non-religious and secular positions (such as atheist or agnostic), these are often misunderstood or misapplied by laypersons. Even where they are correctly used it is clear that—for example—atheists differ in their emotional responses to religion, their intellectual interest in religion, and their behavioural repertoire with regard to religious individuals and institutions. Rather than attempting to generate a typology from philosophical grounds we see merit in allowing a typology to emerge empirically, thus tapping nonreligiosity as it is lived. This paper will present data from a 24-item scale intended to capture dimensions of non-religiosity within a sample of 131 British adult subjects selfdescribing as atheists or agnostics. Four potential dimensions of non-religiosity emerging from factor analysis will be examined together with an exploration of potential types of non-religiosity that emerge from cluster analysis of subjects.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
"Christo-secular ambivalence in British security policy, 2001-2009",Stacey Gutkowski,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Although secularism has recently become a site of analysis for international politics, it has as yet received little theoretical elaboration in the area of security studies. A new research programme is needed to further this end, one that is not merely a secondary addendum to the existing one on religion and security. This paper suggests some directions for that research agenda, that turns to examine how trajectories of secularisation and non-religion in Britain impacted on security policy towards radical Islam between 2001-2009. It seems that a kind of Christo-secular ambivalence has afflicted British security policy, both in the case of threat perception and the management of risk.

Theoretical and methodological resources for breaking open the secular and exploring the boundary between religion and non-religion,Kim Knott,University of Leeds,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The secular condition, secularism and the associated non-religious ideological categories of agnosticism and atheism have particular significance in contemporary Europe. Given that these concepts and their associated fields of belief, practice and organization represent a counter-field of interest for scholars of religion, as well as an increasingly important arena in the politics of religion, we ignore them at our peril. I shall consider the conceptual and categorical relationship between the religious and the secular, the boundary which separates them, and the resources that are available in the study of religion for examining this relationship. In particular, I shall refer to three approaches: historical/conceptual, spatial/discursive, and cognitive/cultural. These are all tools for understanding more about how we see imagine, define, classify and represent religion and its other (whether we call that non-religion or the secular), tools that, once employed, might challenge the categories we use and the anxieties they induce. Furthermore, I will examine what happens around the boundary between the religious and the secular and make a case for a reconstitution of the object of the discipline of religious studies to include non-religion as well as religion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
A secular mind,Jonathan A. Lanman,University of Oxford,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Cognitive anthropologists argue that we can better answer enduring anthropological questions by utilizing the growing insights of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This belief is not wholly unjustified, as cognitive anthropologists have had some success in addressing the long-standing question of why religious beliefs and practices are so widespread in human populations, mostly in reference to universal cognitive biases. This success, however, raises another enduring anthropological question, that of how to best account for ―secularization.‖ If religious beliefs are so well supported by universal cognitive biases, whence secularization and atheism? In this presentation, I will argue that a cognitive approach can help answer one important element of the secularization debate, the question of whether or not particular socio-economic environments cause decreased levels of religious belief and commitment. I will present both qualitative and quantitative data from my fieldwork and survey research among non-theists in Western countries suggesting that particular socio-economic environments do indeed lower levels of religious belief and that this effect occurs through the impact of these environments on our cognitive mechanisms devoted to reasoning about social groups and about what representations to accept from others.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
Members of Atheist/Freethought/Secularist organizations in Germany and the United States,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I would like to contribute a paper documenting my current research on organized atheism in Germany and the United States. With my study, I set out to investigate the motives, experiences, and biographies of those who have become more or less active members of primarily politically oriented (rather than philosophical, academic, or congregational) atheist / freethought / secularist organizations. While focusing only on members of this particular type of organization, my aim has been to vary the members‘ characteristics with regard to their age, gender, duration of membership, degree of activism, and socio-religious background as much as possible. With respect to the latter aspect, I have conducted interviews with members of German IBKA (International League of Non-Religious and Atheists) and BfG (Bavarian Freethought Association) in generally atheistic Berlin, religiously mixed North Rhine Westphalia, and traditionally Catholic Bavaria, as well as with members of local chapters and affiliates of the U.S. organizations American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International in California, Minnesota, and Georgia.

"The good atheistic Samaritan: Intrinsic, extrinsic and quest atheism and its relationship with prosocial behaviour",Sven Oelsner,University of Jena,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Contemporary psychological research concerning the relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour shows an ambiguous picture. Some researchers found a correlation between religiousness and helping behaviour (Bernt, 1989; Hansen, Vandenberg, & Patterson, 1995; Sappington & Baker, 1995) where others did not (Darley & Batson, 1973; Smith, Wheeler, & Diener, 1975; Sundeen & Raskoff, 1995). In studies documenting positive effects religiousness was frequently investigated with qualitative measures such as the intrinsic, extrinsic and quest religiosity scales proposed by Batson (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991). These scales are based on underlying constructs covering social activities, philosophical thinking, ritualistic behaviour and worldview scepticism practiced by atheists and theists alike. However, terms specifically associated with Christianity (e.g. church, prayer, bible) increase the item difficulty for atheists and generate variance in the theistic sample only. The study to be presented investigated the question whether religiosity scales measure theistic/ supernatural beliefs or rather social, cultural and philosophical activities. The results indicate that the supposed relationship between religiousness and prosocial behaviour is not based on theistic religiosity (i.e. belief in the existence of supernatural beings) but rather on sociocultural attitudes shared by theists and atheists.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
A British secular–religious cleavage?,Stratos Patrikios,University of Strathclyde,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The growing visibility of secular commentators and organisations in Britain is often regarded as evidence of a cultural conflict between ‗the Secular‘ and 'the Religious'. Two key assumptions underlie this popular account: that there is growing disagreement between the two groups, and that each group is a homogenous actor that can be mobilised against the other. But are these assumptions supported in reality? For instance, can we meaningfully speak of a 'secular' camp on cultural issues? The paper answers these questions by examining whether the controversy we see in the media reflects a divide at the mass level. The analysis uses survey data to model distributional measures of public opinion over time (1983-2007). Two types of social attitudes are examined: positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relations. Results identify a widening gap between the non religious and the religious (esp. Anglicans) regarding attitudes towards homosexual relations. This widening gap is a function of the differential rate of liberalisation that has affected both groups. However, if the gap is to be consequential for social and political developments, each competing group should be growing increasingly homogenous. Findings suggest that there is no such trend in the internal coherence of the two groups.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
Atheism in post-socialist conditions: The examples of Slovenia and Croatia,Marjan Smrke,University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"While the majority of countries in Western Europe have become more secular in recent times, most post-socialist countries have been undergoing a process of desecularization. The disintegration of the socialist regime in Yugoslavia, which functioned as a sort of secular civil religion, took place in a period of escalating intranational tensions, conflicts, and ethno-religious mythologies. Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina, the nations most involved in the military conflicts from 1991 to 1995, have undergone a marked desecularization on the societal, organizational, and individual levels. From some perspectives, it might appear that Slovenia is an exception to this trend, as its transition to independence did not trigger a desecularization factor or what Steve Bruce termed ―cultural defence‖. But nevertheless we can speak in all of these cases of the essentially altered social position of atheism. If it was privileged before, it is now affected by strengthened and emboldened church ideologies. We observe in both Slovenia and Croatia the re-emergence of certain traditional attitudes toward atheism, which Colin Cambell, in his Toward a Sociology of Irreligion, called Victorian prejudices (Cambell, 1974). For this reason, I have undertaken in recent years the empirical testing of the following theses that have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral, and; 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Church about educated Slovenians and Croatians are unsubstantiated. Especially in Slovenia, both ―conviced atheists‖ and ―natural atheists‖ show (according to their own statements) above-average happiness, above-average reflection on life, above-average moral rigour and are less distanced from various social minorities. The reasons for such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia and Croatia on the other. The dialectic relationship between these two phenomena justifies (once again) the conclusion that the sociology of religion must incorporate the sociology of non-religiosity/irreligion.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
The challenge of popular religion to atheism: a socio-cognitive approach,Steven Sutcliffe,University of Edinburgh,Scotland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a recent British opinion poll, 64% (n=1000) believe that ‗some people have powers that cannot be explained by science‘, 49% believe in ghosts, and 41% believe in communication with the dead. Earlier Gorer (1955), in a survey conducted in an English newspaper, found equally robust levels of belief in ghosts, reincarnation and horoscopes. The ‗new age‘ or ‗holistic‘ milieu is similarly fecund (Sutcliffe 2003, Heelas and Woodhead 2005). I argue that such qualitative evidence in the UK (for example) suggests that – despite apparent triumphs of secular modernity - religious belief and practice is alive and well in its popular, ‗theologically incorrect‘ (Barrett 1999/Slone 2004) expressions. These expressions support more complex, synthetic and/or discursive forms of ‗religion‘, making the articulation of ‗religion‘ in ordinary, everyday life settings appear unremarkable and ‗natural‘. On this evidence, modernity and popular religion are not mutually exclusive, secularization has in-built limitations, and atheism – defined as predicating social identity on denial of god(s) - is likely to remain a pursuit of intellectual minorities. I argue that ‗folk‘ narratives and models are a better guide to what ‗religion‘ is like at the point of production than sophisticated and abstracted reflections produced by specially trained elites (whether religious or secular). They also point to the persistence and longevity of ‗religion‘ insofar as cognitive representations generated below the level of conscious awareness instinctively reinforce socially constructed discourses. The elementary forms of ‗religion‘ are thus co-produced by cognitive processes in human brains operating in synchronization with sociological forces of order and legitimation. Atheism is likely to find this popular double act hard to breach.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
Methodological challenges in understanding different modes and locations of irreligiosity,Teemu Taira,University of Leeds,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper demonstrates how to make use of existing survey data on religion when studying Atheism and irreligiosity. I shall suggest that it is useful to make a distinction between Atheism (as an identity tag) and general irreligiosity (for example indifference). This is especially so, because the current debate on New Atheism is dividing the irreligious: some identify themselves as atheists while others refuse to do so. Furthermore, it is helpful to study the phenomenon by not simply looking at beliefs but also identification, attitudes, participation, private practice and membership (including reflections on future membership). The importance of these distinctions lies in an attempt to construct a coherent picture of the varying modes and locations of Atheism and irreligiosity. It also may change the way the issue is dealt with more generally, because in public discourse these distinctions are often neglected. Although my research is focused on public discourse in Britain and Finland, in this example I will focus upon Finnish society. I shall suggest, however, that the methodological strategies can be applied to all societies where Western-style discourse on religion exists. Instead of simply attempting to explain the Finnish situation by referring to meaningful sociological variables such as education, gender, class, age and region, I shall combine the survey data – World Values Survey, Church Monitor and Gallup Ecclesiastica (1995–2005) – with systematically collected newspaper material to offer an interpretation of the Finnish situation. Two observations will be made: firstly, Finnish people are belonging (to religious organisations because of others) but not practising (themselves); secondly, they are rather irreligious (indifferent, non-religious) but not self-identifying Atheists. The connection between these two observations will be discussed.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
The 'return of religion' and the return of the criticism of religion: The 'New Atheism' in recent German and American culture,Thomas Zenk,Free University of Berlin,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Criticism of religion can be found throughout the ages, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. It appears that history of religions itself can be interpreted as continued criticisms of one religion against another (e.g. Christianity as criticism of Judaism and Mediterranean pagan polytheism, Buddhism as criticism of Hinduism and so on) or within one religion (phenomena such as reform movements, fundamentalism etc.). Both, in intra-religious as well as inter-religious criticisms the frame of religion is not transcended. An explicit non-religious criticism of religion, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the history. It can be traced back to the European Age of Enlightenment. Nowadays, atheistic or even anti-religious voices have returned and the books by the so-called ""New atheists"" (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett) are all bestsellers and were widely and vividly discussed. Both, the theses and arguments of the ""New atheists"" as well as their public reception are examined in the course of a research project at the Free University of Berlin. Our project aims to analyze these two aspects in a historical comparison of the situation in Europe and the United States. By means of a discourse analysis, we hope to gain insights about the relations between what is called ―the return of religion‖ (Riesebrodt) and the return of the criticism of religion. At the 2009 NSRN our first findings will be presented.",2009,Conference,Non-religion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives,.,.
.,Katie Aston,University of London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Scholarly understandings of the growth of secularism in the 20th century assumed the retreat of religion into the private sphere, yet an upsurge in public expressions of religious practice have been observed in recent years in which material culture and new technologies play a vital role (Morgan 2008, Keane 2008). Such developments compound the need for greater critical comprehension of lived experiences of secularism, as highlighted by leading scholars including Professor Linda Woodhead, at the AHRC Innovative Methods in the Study of Religion conference (2010; also Asad 2009, Cannell 2010). Accordingly I shall conduct the first ethnographic study of explicit public enactments and experiences of secularism and nonreligious values in the UK, interrogating contemporary notions of secularism and its entanglement with religious practice. I will focus on individuals and groups in Britain mobilising publicly around values of non-religion and secularism, exploring their ritual symbolism, verbal and visual language; I will document the range of emergent material forms, rituals and networks using visual ethnographic methods (Banks 1999, Pink 2001). Preliminary research into the 2008 “Atheist Bus Campaign”, initiated in direct response to religious advertising campaigns, highlighted the significance of visual and verbal non-religious performance, including advertising and networking locally and internationally through new media. I anticipate that many contemporary public expressions of non-religion area response to public religious expressions in a multi-religious context and draw on historically embedded Christian ideology (Cannell 2005).",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.

.,Patrick McKearney,University of Cambridge,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Stand-up is a popular part of mainstream British and Irish culture. Yet it is rarely noted that nonreligious viewpoints are frequently expressed in the regular ridicule of religion (atheism and secularism receive comparatively little attention). But this study found that religion is ridiculed in significantly different ways. My research looks at six comedianS: Eddy Izzard, Dara O‟Briain, Dylan Moran, Ricky Gervais, Stewart Lee and Marcus Brigstocke. The former three ridicule flaws in religious people. But crucially they also ridicule these traits in non-religious people. The ultimate target of their ridicule is distinction between the religious and non-religious. They laugh with those they ridicule. The latter three, by contrast, ridicule traits from a position of superiority. Their target is an outsider group that they distance themselves from. They do not sympathise with religious people but laugh at them. The evidence of this diversity adds empirical substance to postsecularist critiques and so undermines a common discourse that conceives of ridicule as a homogeneous form. The differences between these forms are essential to understanding the sociological implications of the ridicule of religion, particularly in poorly understood political events such as the Danish Cartoons.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.
.,Sarah Jane-Page,University of Nottingham,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I am currently developing a proposal to investigate the meanings and values around Christian festivals such as Christmas and Easter for those at the fringes of Christian belief (i.e. those willing to celebrate major Christian festivals but who would not participate in formal religion) and why these festivals carry such popular salience. One method I hope to utilise is video diary and video elicitation interviews. Basically, this will be a project seeking to identify the benefits people accrue through celebrating Christian festivals in a secular context, including a consideration of familial ties, nostalgia, consumerism and gendered work (such festivals involve a huge amount of planning and organisation, where traditional gendered divisions of labour may be reinscribed, despite increased egalitarianism in other spheres). It is thus focusing on religion and secularism at a cultural crossroads, where the religious and the secular are at an intersection or boundary, embedded in each other, but where politics of meaning are fraught and contested (Knott 2005). This is borne out by the Christian distaste of Christmas consumerism, often portrayed in outlets such as the ""Church Times"", or by the incongruence in popularity of Christmas carol services, where cathedrals and churches are filled to the brim with participants who may never set foot into a church at any other time of year. Although studies addressing the popular salience of Christian festivals in a secular context have been addressed in the United States (E.g. Pleck 2000), to my knowledge there is very little work being carried out in the UK.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.

.,Leo Schlöndorff,University of Vienna,Austria,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"My dissertation is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration of two historians, one media scientist and two literary scholars. The project covers the reception of apocalypse in various contexts from the early middle age until contemporary times. I am concerned with the apocalypse of the 20th and 21st century. As a literary scholar I meanly analyze fiction and to some extent film, but I also catch try to catch a glimpse of apocalyptic prophecy in science. In a postmodern context the concept of the end has changed fundamentally. There seem to be not just one end, but a plurality of possible ends: The End of history, the end of class struggle, the end of philosophy, the death of God, the end of religions, the end of Christianity and morals […], the end of the subject, the end of man, the end of the West, the end of Oedipus, the end of the earth, Apocalypse now […]”. (Derrida 1983). Some key questions concerning the “secularized apocalypse” are: In a secularized age thinking the end is not any more a practice restricted to religion. Scientific models dominate our picture of the end of the world. Wars, ecological disasters, and cosmic catastrophes have the power to destroy the world as we know it. In this context apocalypse becomes an umbrella term for many phenomena which all have in common a complete or near complete destruction of the world. In a biblical sense from this point a renewal of the world would happen. But is this the case in a secularized apocalypse? What happens after the Day X if there is no hope for an intervention from god? Is there still space for a vision of a new and better world or is it just the survival of some unlucky people in an unpleasant place which once had been our world?",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.

I‟m using oral histories and autobiographies to reveal how people described their own loss of faith and the age at which this occurs. In the last ten years the social history of religion in Britain has been dominated by the idea that the „religious crisis‟ of the 1960s marked a watershed in the dechristianisation of Britain. Historians have suggested a variety of causal explanations for this, however, atheist apostasy is not amongst them. My work shows that apostates dechristianised from the beginning of the century and unbelief spread in the non-elite population until it was able to find expression in public discourse during the social revolution of the 1960s. In the preceding decades there were atheistic sub-cultures such as radical politics or university education which allowed some to realise their unbelief, yet others rejected religion with little apparent external influence. Apostasy tended to occur during adolescence, so we must look to the influences on children that shape beliefs, such as parenting, peer attitudes, education and entertainment, to explain how atheist apostates came to reject religious socialisation.",2010,Workshop,Qualitative Methods in the Study of Nonreligion,.,.

NSRN Glossary,Lois Lee,University of Cambridge,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Given that the core terminology for nonreligion often involves terms with allocated rather than intrinsic meaning (c.f. for example ‘unreligion’, ‘nonreligion’, ‘areligion’), this glossary gives a guide to how such terms are used throughout this website. N.B. This terminology does not include definitions of religion, theism or other relative concepts. The argument is that being precise about different forms of contingency is useful in itself – and are meaningfully distinct regardless of how their NSRN Glossary contingent terms are understood. E.g. the concept of ‘nonreligion’ is contingent on notions of ‘religion’, which might be viewed as an analytic category or as a human construction or as both.

Modes of Non-Religiosity,Johannes Quack,University of Heidelberg,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In academic no less than popular thought, India is frequently represented as the quintessential land of religion. Disenchanting India qualifies this representation through an analysis of the contemporary Indian rationalist organisations (those that affirm the values and attitudes of atheism, humanism or free-thinking).To understand the genesis of organised rationalism in India the book addresses the rationalists’ emphasis on maintaining links to atheism and materialism in ancient India and outlines their strong ties to the intellectual currents of modern European history. At the heart of Disenchanting India lies an ethnography of the organisation “Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti” (Organisation for the Eradication of Superstition) based in Maharashtra. This account describes the organization’s efforts to promote a scientific temper and combat the beliefs and practices it regards as superstitious. It also includes an analysis of rationalism in the day to day lives of its members and in relation to the organization’s controversial position within Indian society.The book outlines the distinguishing characteristics of this organisation through a depiction of the rationalists’ specific “mode of unbelief” in comparison to “modes of religiosity”. Alongside a critical engagement with the work of Max Weber and Charles Taylor, the theoretical discussion of modes of unbelief further provides an original basis for comparative studies of similar movements in a trans-cultural perspective. Finally, Disenchanting India can be situated within the contemporary debates about the nature of rationalism in Indian intellectual life and cultural politics. It thereby engages with debates that are as crucial for Anthropology and Religious Studies as they are for Post-colonial Studies, Sociology and History.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.
Secularity,Marian Burchardt,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,Cora Schuh,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularity should be understood as a symbolic order that structures the relationships between religious and secular domains in a given society as well as the boundaries between them. These domains have institutional and cultural dimensions and are made up of objects, discursive practices, taken-for-granted assumptions and imaginaries designated as secular or religious. Secularity is then a term encompassing the religious-secular binary and built upon discourses and practices, which deploy this distinction. This understanding is in line with, and inspired by, sociological theories of social differentiation. But rather than ahistorically given it treats the boundaries between religion and secular domains as historically produced and contested.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.
Defining ‘Atheism’: A Modest Proposal,Stephen Bullivant,St. Mary's University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Lois Lee’s draft glossary provides us which much – and valuable – food for thought. However with one definition, at least, I find myself in disagreement: Atheism – a conscious or unconsious lack of commitment to God(s) (2011: 2) Commitment strikes me as a problematic and ambiguous category. Is this a lack of intellectual commitment – e.g., ‘a... lack of commitment to (the idea that there exists [a]) God(s)’ ? Or a lack of what one might term an existential commitment – e.g., ‘a... lack of (personal, devoted, trusting?) commitment to God(s)’? The former might imply the latter, but the same is not true vice versa. It can be argued that while a great many Britons have at least some kind of intellectual commitment to the idea of God existing (even if this commitment extends only to ticking the requisite box on sociologists’ surveys), comparatively few have the kind of existential commitment to God(s), traditionally expressed through regular prayer, attendance at religious services, etc. This ambiguity could, of course, be clarified fairly satisfactorily. However, I believe a far better and usable definition of ‘atheism’ – one already in scholarly use – can be located in the category not of ‘commitment’, but of ‘belief’. What I want to do in this short paper, then, is simply to outline what I believe to be a fairly uncontroversial definition of atheism already in scholarly use: ‘a lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods’. While I will be presenting a case for the utility of this definition, I do not intend to do so in any exhaustive, defeat-all-comers way. All I am wanting to do is to put one (I think good) definition on the table, as a stimulus to discussion and debate.",2011,Conference,Terminology for Nonreligion and Secularity Research,.,.

In addition, those raised with no religion are increasingly likely to have no religious preference as adults. Despite their growing numbers, individuals raised with no religion have received little attention from scholars. The adult religious preferences of these individuals provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test theories of religion and social change. Using General Social Survey data, I examine the adult religious preferences and beliefs of individuals raised with no religion. I provide evidence of a shift in socialization and social influences experienced by those who report growing up with no religion. Compared with earlier cohorts raised with no religion, more recent cohorts have had more secular upbringings and tend to be more secular, liberal, and wary of organized religion as adults. They are also more likely to have a religiously unaffiliated spouse, if they marry at all. Results from a logistic regression analysis indicate that these trends explain much of the cohort differences in the likelihood of remaining unaffiliated as an adult.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.

However, much of this scholarship relies on two critical and largely unaddressed assumptions: (a) that when people report negative attitudes toward atheists, they do so because they are reacting specifically to their lack of belief in God; and (b) that survey questions asking about attitudes toward atheists as a group yield reliable information about biases against individual atheist targets. To test these assumptions, an online survey asked a probability-based random sample of American adults (N = 618) to evaluate a fellow research participant (“Jordan”). Jordan garnered significantly more negative evaluations when identified as an atheist than when described as religious or when religiosity was not mentioned. This effect did not differ as a function of labeling (“atheist” versus “no belief in God”), or the amount of individuating information provided about Jordan. These data suggest that both assumptions are tenable: nonbelief—rather than extraneous connotations of the word “atheist”—seems to underlie the effect, and participants exhibited a marked bias even when confronted with an otherwise attractive individual.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.

Various institutions – the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CIA, the World Values Survey, Gallup, and many others – have performed sophisticated statistical analyses on cross-national data. The present investigation demonstrates that valid and reliable data concerning religiosity and secularity exist for most countries and that these data are comparable. Cross-national data relating to social, political, economic and cultural aspects of life were tested for correlation with religiosity/secularity. In contrast to the most widely accepted general account of secularity, the Existential Security Framework (ESF; Norris & Inglehart, 2004), secularity was not most highly related to material security, though these were highly related. Rather, secularity was most strongly related to the degree of formal education attained. Material security explained no significant variance beyond education. Thus, religion’s primary function in the world today is being replaced, not so much by the pseudo-materialistic supplication for better living conditions as posited by the ESF, but by contemporary education – extensive knowledge of contemporary cultures, philosophy, modes of thought or processes of reasoning.",2012,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,1,.

Non-theists and theists as a whole, as well as theist subgroup assessments, were compared. Data were collected through self-report surveys. Additionally, to test moral decision-making abilities, participants answered questions based on situational dilemmas. Using Kohlberg’s coding schema, scores were assigned for the participant’s global moral reasoning rather than for the content of their answers. Using independent groups t-test, ANOVA, and post-hoc tests,our findings suggest no support for the existence of the stereotype that non-theists are less moral than theists.

Collective identities were expressed mainly through individual values and experiences, indicating a sense of belonging to a group, but little consensus about what is shared between its members. Most participants used terms for religious, ethnic, regional and national groups interchangeably to describe their traditions and morals. In contrast, those few who had a strong personal religious identity distinguished sharply between the religious and national, individual and collective aspects of their identities.

The paper identifies socio-demographic and geographic factors that are associated with the religiosity cluster to which a person belongs. The paper examines the ability of the new scale to predict how people will answer questions on contentious societal issues, using belief in evolution as a case study.

This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced ‘irreligious socialisation’, rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12–18% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as ‘unarticulated causes’ of the subjects’ irreligion.",2014,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,3,.

Diversity among speakers (defined using multivariate statistics in terms of the representation of women and non-white people) increased significantly over time during the period studied. This broadening participation may have arisen from interventions to address issues of representation or may simply reflect a generational shift in the demographics of the community.

Espousing Apostasy and Feminism? Older and Younger British Female Apostates Compared,Janet Betty Eccles,Independent scholar,United Kingdom,F,Rebecca Catto,Coventry University,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"It has been acknowledged that white western men are more likely to leave their former religion behind (Altemeyer and Hunsberger, 1997, Zuckerman, 2012), or declare themselves of no religion (Brown and Lynch, 2012, Baker and Smith, 2009), than women (Beit-Hallahmi, 2007). But it has not been unknown for women, even in the past, both of the older and younger generations to do the same (Budd 1977; Schwarz 2010). This article, based on two small scale studies in the United Kingdom, considers a group of older and a group of younger women ‘apostates’, to determine what leads them to do this and examines whether developing a feminist orientation plays a role. Religious women in second wave feminism were often ignored, having been considered to have chosen patriarchy over feminism while there is some evidence that women with feminist attitudes are less likely to be religious (Redfern and Aune, 2013, 154, Furseth, 2010, 210). Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis to determine overarching themes, while the three-fold typology of apostasy developed by Zuckerman (2012) allowed the authors to examine similarities and differences between older and younger women who choose to leave religion behind. They conclude reasons for apostasy are various, certainly not solely attributable to developing a feminist orientation.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.

We conducted two studies to test whether presenting recent scientific findings regarding the nonreligious bases of morality (e.g., morality in nonhuman primates and preverbal infants) might lead people to view morality as innate, thus reducing intuitive associations of immorality and atheism. Consistent with previous research, participants viewed moral transgressions as more representative of atheists than of Christians. However, learning about the putatively innate nature of morality did not lead participants to view immorality as less representative of atheists.

To date, however, no studies have taken a reflexive approach to these themes or applied them in the field to test their analytical utility as well as their relations in contemporary atheist experience. This study employs a mixed-methods approach that includes in-depth interviews (n = 19), participant observation, and one survey administered to two atheist groups, one local (n = 151) and one national (n = 456). Ethnographic findings confirm the central role of stigma, identity, and community in atheist experience and emphasize their nestedness in one another. Survey results find that atheist affiliates in both national and local groups rate political activism as more important than social reasons in motivating them to affiliate, while local affiliates rated social reasons significantly higher than national affiliates rated social reasons. Suggestions for future research include consideration of these themes’ connectedness in subsequent analyses and further inquiry into the functional divergences between local and national atheist organizations.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.
“‘Need a Minister? How About Your Brother?’: The Universal Life Church between Religion and Non-Religion”,Dusty Hoesly,University of California,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"National media outlets have observed that weddings in the United States, especially for young educated people, are increasingly performed by ministers who are friends or relatives of the couple and who become ordained online just for that purpose. The primary organization licensing these ministers, and thus authorizing these weddings as legally valid, is the Universal Life Church (ULC), which has ordained over 20 million people since 1962. To date, there has been no focused study of the ULC or lifecycle rituals conducted under its auspices. According to my original survey, interview, and participant observation data, both ULC ministers and the couples who engage them typically self-describe as non-religious, usually as spiritual, seekers, humanist, or generically “not religious.” Similarly, they describe their weddings in “non-religious” terms, emphasizing the personalization of the ceremony to match their particular beliefs and tastes as well as the conscious exclusion of most “religious” language. These “secular” or “spiritual” wedding ceremonies reveal non-religious couples’ desires for an alternative apart from bureaucratic civil ceremonies or traditional religious rites. This article explains why “secular” people select ULC ministers for their weddings, how ULC ministers see themselves as “non-religious” while being members of a legally-recognized religion, and how ULC ministers and couples married by them label and valuate their “non-religious,” personalized wedding ceremonies. My examination of ULC membership and weddings reveals not only the diversity of non-theistic self-identification and lifecycle ritualization, but also how constructs such as “religious” and “secular” can be co-constitutive rather than purely oppositional.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.

Notably different from the distribution of Silver’s national sample of nonbelievers, the nonreligious PSTs were much less engaged in their nonbelief and were more willing to comply with religious activities. The nonreligious PSTs were drawn to teaching due to their love of learning, and they intend to promote critical thinking and tolerance in their classrooms; however, 13 (87%) wof the PSTs expressed concern about the negative impact their lack of religion might have on their careers and intend to keep their lack of belief private.",2015,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,4,.

"British Ex-Muslims: Constructing and negotiating the ""essential and revolutionary""",Halima Begum,Birkbeck University of London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The phenomenon of people leaving their religion is a common feature of many post-Christian Western societies. However, the investigation of the phenomenon of apostasy has mainly been restricted to Christian apostates. Apostasy in minority communities, specifically the Muslim community, is not well understood. This study investigates the why and the how of the construction of the “Ex-Muslim” identity, defined as atheists and agnostics who have left Islam. A small-scale study with a qualitative, grounded theory approach within a social constructivism paradigm was used to explore the construction of the Ex-Muslim identity, and how Ex-Muslims managed and negotiated the stigma attached to their identity. Ten semistructured interviews and one focus group (five participants) were conducted to investigate why participants chose to call themselves ‘Ex-Muslims’ and what the consequences of embracing this identity were. Results revealed two dimensions to understand this identity. The first category conceptualises the stigmatisation from Muslim and the non-Muslim society, and a displacement of the self, lack of parental acceptance and gendered experiences as the defining factors in the realities of Ex-Muslims. The second category showed the strategies used to navigate the Ex-Muslim identity, consisting of a complex set of performance acts to manage social interactions as well as the construction of an Ex-Muslim community. The results show that the conditions of stigmatisation of apostasy can stimulate the displacement of the self, resulting into an evolving Ex-Muslim identity. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of negotiation of identities through performances (Goffman, 1963) as well as the concept of the ‘ex’ role identity (Ebaugh, 1988).",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Methodological challenges in conducting research on irreligious Tunisians,Yosr Ben Slima,King's College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This presentation will examine the methodological difficulties related to the study of the nonreligion phenomenon within Tunisia (a Muslim-majority country). I argue that the problem stems from the difficulty of defining and locating nonreligion, especially in the absence of any forms of organization. Certain material manifestations of nonreligion can be signs of unorthodox Islam rather than material signs of nonreligion ,while abidance by some Islamic rituals is not necessarily a sign of piety and belief. I propose the neologism ‘practicing irreligious Tunisians’ to refer to irreligious individuals who consciously choose to continue performing Islamic rituals. Abiding by certain Islamic rituals has become for these irreligious Tunisians living with traditional Muslim families, a manner to develop more empathy, by refusing to inflict pain on their beloved ones. This moral consideration is shaped by what these irreligious Tunisians refer to as ‘humane values’ or in a more ironic manner ‘ ethics of Kofar’2 . The methodological challenge resides in distinguising between unorthodoxy and nonreligion .Who is a real irreligious Tunisian ? To understand the subversive nature of the
irreligious performance of Islamic rituals , I rely on the virtual sphere which presents an outlet
used by many irreligious Tunisians to express their ‘authentic selves’. I combine both virtual
ethnography and long-term relationships with irreligious Tunisians to explore nonreligion in a
context where the fear of social rejection and the ambivalence of the legal system vis-à-vis
nonreligious Tunisians make it difficult to openly approach the subject in the public sphere.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Reimagining the Secular: The Sunday Assembly - Belonging without Believing.,Josh Bullock,Kingston University of London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Grace Davie (1994) famously wrote over two decades ago that ‘the overall pattern of religious life is changing. For it appears that more and more people within British Society want to believe but do not want to involve themselves in religious practice.’ Hence, the catchphrase ‘believing without belonging’ was coined. Twenty-two years later has the (non)religious landscape changed once again? My doctoral research follows the Sunday Assembly, a secular congregation that celebrates life, with the motto: live better, help often and wonder more. Their vision is: to help everyone live life as fully as possible. The Sunday Assembly entered the non-religious market place in January 2013 with their flagship London congregation. Now, 68- franchised chapters of the Godless congregation exist in 8 different countries, attempting to provide community, belonging and wonder to the religiously unaffiliated market. Once described as ‘the best bits of church but with no religion and with awesome pop songs!’, the best bits literally borrow established successful terminology, practices, liturgies and models of building community found within Christian churches. Often labelled oxymoronically the ‘atheist church’ - it parallels and mimics the functionality of church life without the need for a deity. Therefore, studying the Sunday Assembly may offer a new variation to Davie’s ‘believing without belonging’ that is ‘belonging without believing.’ As more and more people now identify as being non-religious in the United Kingdom and America, this paper will aim to answer what factors are enticing people towards the Sunday Assembly and their nonreligious practice. This paper will present findings from my analysis of the Sunday Assembly. Drawing upon 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews and a year-long ethnography spent with the London Sunday Assembly congregation.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Cultivating the reasonable hiloni self: a case of secular self-fashioning?,Stacey Gutkowski,King’s College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"As a contribution to debates on the emotional dimension of the secular, I look at practices of self-fashioning, particularly the cultivation and performance of the self as ‘reasonable’. Using the case of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I argue that ‘secular’ self-fashioning may sometimes have little to do with individuals engaging the secular-religious boundary in a particular society through processes of self-differentiation. I also argue that hiloni cultivation of reasonableness is an emotio-political outcome of a long-standing and unresolved ideological problem within Zionist thought. Reasonableness is not simply an emotional practice of self-cultivation but has also – indirectly and often unintentionally – facilitated and rendered opaque practices of Israeli state sovereignty over many aspects of Palestinian life. Secularity has facilitated sovereign governance of Palestinian social life but not through political secularism per se, which further illuminates the intersection between individual ‘secular affect’ and state sovereignty.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Being areligious in Antiquity – Individual Dimensions of Disbelief,Nicole Hartmann,Humboldt-University of Berlin,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Studies on Antiquity are mostly stuck in their dependence on literary sources. Philosophical, antiquarian, judicial or theological reflections, tragic, satirical, polemical or apologetic texts were mostly produced by 'organizational men' (Jörg Rüpke). They set the agenda of proper behaviour, norms and practices and, what they consider to be deviant. They create the dichotomy of 'religion' and 'atheism'. „Battling the Gods. Atheism in the Ancient World“ (2015) by Tim Whitmarsh is just the latest example of how difficult it is for scholars to look beyond these dominating discourses. The project I am thinking about aims at individual aspects of disbelief and personal reasons for denying to participate in rituals and cults or merely being indifferent towards 'religion'. So far my approach is informed by the 'Lived Ancient Religion' concept of the ERC funded Research Group at the Max Weber Kolleg Erfurt and the theoretical framework of the 'Multiple Secularities' project at the University of Leipzig. The biggest methodological challenge will be the quest for sources and testimonies, since there are no ego-documents of 'confessing' sceptics or atheists. One has to analyze indirect sources as, for example, leges sacrae and will meet a lot of difficulties to distinguish wilful disregard from unintentional transgression etc. Nonetheless, in my point of view, it is about time to conceptualize these individual dimensions of non-religion for the ancient world (namely in the time and space of the Roman Empire) and ask about the dynamics it set free in groups responses.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Politics and Religion in Contemporary Turkey: Perspectives of Atheists,Tayfun Kasapoglu,Vytautas Magnus University,Lithuania,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In a society where religion is very present in public life, conducting research on atheists itself may become an act of contestation, especially if atheists constitute a small minority and are perceived as deviant in the society. In my on-going qualitative research on self-identified atheists in contemporary Turkey, I aim to investigate atheists’ perceptions on relations between politics and religion, as well as to understand how this relationship affects atheists’ personal experiences in society. As a part of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with atheists from different backgrounds in Turkey. In these interviews, atheists based their perspectives on personal experiences and did not strictly differentiate between religious and nonreligious. The informants often perceived current politics and religion as closely linked to each other and underlined an increasing religiosity and polarization in society drawing on examples related to media, gender, politics and education. While there were significant differences between opinions of atheists from religious and secular families, almost all the informants regarded religion as an expansionist power that is becoming more visible in every area of social life with the policies imposed by the current right-wing government. They recommended limiting religion to the private sphere and thus creating secular spaces in which not only religious Muslims but everyone could thrive.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Making implicit nonreligious attitudes visible: secular criticism of religion and spirituality within societal institutions,Christiane Königstedt,University of Leipzig,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The study of nonreligion is, besides analyses of state secularism, very often concerned with nonreligious persons in the minority position, who are themselves perceived as contestations to religious world-views. For the opposite case, i.e. secular societies where nonreligious world-views are also dominant, Charles Taylor and José Casanova (2011) stated, that the latter would have the tendency to “naturalize” and thus become unconsciously held attitudes. Since what is taken for granted is rarely mentioned explicitly as well as there is by no means a canonized set of nonreligious beliefs collectively shared, those are difficult investigate beyond visible conflicts provoked by either religious groups or by perceived transgressions of taken-for-granted secular realms. Contestations and resulting negotiations may constitute a chance for the researcher (Knott 2007) to investigate ‘naturalized’ assumptions, when it is explicated in order to explain the criticism groups, beliefs or practices. While it has shown that collective actors, groups, are more likely to be differentiated from the “in-group” through evoking a secular collective identity, subtle punctual transgressions of boundaries may reveals details about more diffused nonreligious – and implicit – attitudes and opinions. In this paper I will analyse examples for the latter case, precisely a sample of criticism(s) expressed in German online-newspapers towards perceived transgressions of legitimate (often medical) science by religio-spiritual world-views. Testing Taylor’s and Casanova’s claim in this practical area, the pivotal questions are ‘what is precisely perceived as challenge and how is it characterized’? What is, on the other hand, perceived to be in need of protection, what are the feared dangers? What singular arguments and values are explicated in that defence? The findings from the material shall be discussed concerning their significance and surplus value for the study of nonreligion.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
On the Necessity of Fractionating “Atheism”,Jonathan A. Lanman,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Can “atheism,” be an object of scientific analysis? Academics and other social actors approach “atheism” with a range of interests, producing substantial diversity in how the term is defined, analysed, and utilised. Given the importance of such interests in conceptual construction, one may ask whether “atheism” exists as an independent phenomenon amenable to scientific analysis, or, rather, following the supposed fate of “religion” (Smith, 1998; Fitzgerald, 2000) and the “secular” (Asad, 2003), as a mere social construction. This question is not without consequence. If “atheism” only exists as a socially constructed concept and not as an independent object, then analysis of its supposed causes and effects becomes, like astrology, folly. I will argue that “atheism” is indeed a social construct. This would seem to doom any scientific study of atheism and leave us only to document how the term is experienced and utilized by various social actors. However, I will argue that a science of atheism is still possible. To do so, I will utilize the metatheoretical principle of “fractionation” developed by cognitive anthropologists (Boyer, 1994; Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014) in their scientific studies of “religion.” Fractionating a constructed object of analysis involves breaking it up into distinct phenomena about whose independence we are more confident and which may have divergent causes and effects. Based on my field and survey research with atheists in the US, UK, and Denmark, as well as insights from the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, I will propose three (non-exhaustive) fractionated elements of “atheism:” 1) absence of (implicit/explicit) belief in the existence of God/gods, 2) moral judgement of the immorality of “religion,” and 3) social identities that prominently feature “atheism” or other forms of “nonreligion.” I will argue that each exists in the world beyond our scholarly conceptions and with distinct sets of causes and effects.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Grassroots Atheism and the Atheist Movement,Stephen LeDrew,Uppsala University,Sweden,M,Evelina Lundmark,Uppsala University,Sweden,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this research we examine research done on the (at the time) unmoderated and hugely popular online atheist forum – reddit.com/r/atheism – in relation to the ideology new atheism and the atheist movement in North America. The study on /r/atheism was a qualitative study conducted in early 2013, which traced discursive practices on an online space with no official ties to atheist or humanist organizations. The methodological framework was Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory, and the discussion was placed primarily within critical discussions on the category of religions prevalent within the anthropology of religion. We have found four major correlating themes in our paper: conceptions of authority and human nature; the ‘practice’ of atheism and modes of engagement with religion; and the purposes of the forum and of public expressions of atheism more generally. These themes have also featured prominently in research on atheist beliefs and identity in formal organizations and among atheist leaders and public figures (including, but not restricted to, the New Atheists). Our aim is to compare these public expressions of atheism in order to identify consistencies and also diversity of opinion within and between these levels. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of atheist cultures, especially with regard to their diversity and dominant versus oppositional trends and discourses. Placing the research on /r/atheism in relation to research on the atheist movement grounds the study in social theory, which exists in tension with discourse theory. Our cooperation has thus impelled us to ask questions regarding the use and construction of atheism in our respective work, as well as questions on which scientific research inform our different choices, and how this is reflected in the write up process.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
"Jewish Atheists, Protestant Humanists and Nonreligious Agnostics: Existential Culture, ‘Hybridity’ and Nonreligious Diversity",Lois Lee,University College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The existential dimension of human life has been a minor theme in contemporary social science, in line with the dominant view in social theory (e.g. modernization theory, secularization theory) that the decline of religion, detraditionalisation and other processes of social transformation serve to diminish existential experience in modern and late modern societies. In contrast to such theories, this paper presents evidence that existential life is reformed rather than reduced in contemporary societies. It draws on qualitative research exploring nonreligious identification in southeast England to demonstrate the ways in which informants engage with the existential and metaphysical, not only through thought and belief, but also through rituals, symbolic forms and social interactions. It shows how the variety and cultural contingency of these existential cultures can provide new ways to understand the diversity of nonreligious beliefs and cultures. It also points to commonalities and opportunities for cultural exchange between religious, spiritual and nonreligious existential cultures, and the ways in which individuals may draw on and sometimes combine these different traditions. I argue that a cultural turn in understandings of atheism, nonreligion and secularity help us to understand these complex or ‘hybrid’ existential cultural formations.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Interpreting Active Forms of Atheism and Secularism as a Social Movement,Björn Mastiaux,University of Düsseldorf,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In the wake of so-called „New Atheism“, especially organized forms of nonreligion, atheism, and/or secularism have attracted an unprecedented degree of scholarly attention (see e.g. Cimino and Smith 2014, LeDrew 2016). These studies, mostly on the North American spectrum of atheist, humanist, and secularist organizations, have treated their subject, quite matter-of-factly, as a social movement. In my presentation, I would like to apply theoretical insight from the sociology of social movements to the study of nonreligion and secularity – more specifically to atheist, humanist, and secularist activism in the United States and Germany. On the one hand, I would like to analyze systematically in how far the field of organized and non-organized atheism, humanism, and secularism meets definitions of a social movement and in how far it can justifiably be called that. Most definitions of social movements place emphasis on the existence of formal and informal networks of collective and individual actors, a shared identity, a battle against political or cultural enemies, and the use of non-institutionalized means. So, on the other hand, I am going to portray the formal and informal networks in this field as well as recent dynamics and divergencies with respect to identity, opponents, and strategy using theories of collective action and collective identity. The aim of my paper, therefore, is both theoretical as well as descriptive: bringing theory from the sociology of social movements to fruition in the context of a new subject matter and broadening the empirical treatment of that subject matter to a European case.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Non-Religious Individuals’ Life Satisfaction: Examining the Role of Belief Certainty and Context Factors,Katharina Pöhls,University of Cologne,Germany,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Based on the assumption of a curvilinear effect of belief certainty instead of belief content on psychological well-being, this individual paper explores the influence of belief certainty on non-religious individuals’ life satisfaction with regard to the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development. Self-identification as atheist is used as an indicator for non-religiousness with a high belief certainty. The social norm of non-religiosity is indicated by the national level of individuals identifying as not religious or atheist and the level of societal development is indicated by the level of a population’s health, education, and standard of living. The World Values Survey is used as data source for a quantitative intercultural comparison across 31 countries (N=49,611). Results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average more satisfied with life than atheist and non-religious individuals when only including individual-level variables in the analysis, but that they do not differ in their average level of life satisfaction when interactions with the context factors social norm of non-religiosity and societal development are considered. Additionally, the difference between atheist and religious individuals’ life satisfaction decreases with higher levels of non-religiosity in society. It will be discussed why these
results challenge the assumption of religiosity being related to a general advantage
concerning individuals’ well-being.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
The Varieties of Personal Orientations to Religion: Dynamics of Religious and Nonreligious Positions in Self-Narratives of Well-Educated Young Adults in the Netherlands,Ulrike Popp-Baier,University of Amsterdam,Netherlands,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Self-narratives are well-known resources from which to analyze the subtleties of people’s orientations toward “religion“. They provide the necessary biographical context for addressing individual religiousness in the context of personal concerns, experiences and orientations, thus stressing the diversity and varieties of people’s religious orientations and experiences which are embedded in processes of interpretation and reflection related to activities and events in daily life, and evolving and changing in the course of a lifetime. “Religious” or “nonreligious” people are often not only addressing, adopting, or contesting various contents of belief in plural religious contexts, but also demonstrating various “modes of belief or unbelief ” such as being convinced, trusting, hoping, assuming, preferring, doubting, pondering, denying etc. When we consider these varieties, clear-cut distinctions between “being religious” and “being nonreligious” will often disappear. The main research question in our current project is: What types of religiousness are discernable among well-educated adults in the Netherlands ? We started our empirical research with a preliminary exploratory study which is still ongoing. Until yet 20 selfnarratives (gained by a combination of biographical-narrative interviews with semi-structured interviews) of students at polytechnic institutes of higher learning in the Netherlands have been gathered. The purposive sample aims at maximal variation among self-ascribed religiousness, spirituality, nonreligiousness and non-spirituality. Thus far Catholics and former Catholics, Protestants and former Protestants, Muslims, people affiliated with the socalled holistic milieu and people with no religious affiliation or interest in spirituality at all have been included into the sample. Besides different constellations of religiousness, nonreligiousness, spirituality and “non-spirituality”, a thematic coding analysis of the 20 interviewtranscripts also revealed two common patterns in the interviews thus far: a moral orientation to life and variations of a just-world belief (Lerner, 1980). This paper will elaborate on the different constellations and on the common patterns as well. Conceptual and methodological consequences for a psychological study of “nonreligiousness” will be discussed.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Researching the nonreligious in a secular society,Atko Remmel,University of Tartu,Estonia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. The visibility of religion in society is low and nonreligiosity is considered normative. Estonians are also one of the nations (along with Czechs) in Europe who’s national identity is associated with atheism, in both cases expressed as “the most atheistic country in the world”. Nevertheless, different beliefs and practices associated with New Spirituality and indigenous Earth belief are very common. Thus, secularity in this
context refers mostly to distance from conventional, theistic religion.
The paper draws on the data from recent quantitative survey “On Life, Religion, and
Religious Life” (2015). Among other questions, the survey offered participants two different
possibilities for (non)religious identification, employing also the concept of Multiple Religious
Belonging. Beside the information on religiosity, the results of the analysis also give
interesting information about nonreligious identities in a secular context.
Still, general results of the survey awoke serious doubts about the suitability of
quantitative survey on conventional religion in a largely nonreligious society. In order to
investigate the relevance of the quantitative survey, I conducted a qualitative study among
the nonreligious using mainly the same questions and offering a possibility to explain one’s
answers. The results largely confirmed my doubts. The paper addresses the issues that
became clear during the qualitative study. ",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
"Authorizing Atheism: Leadership, Gender, and the Cult of Personality",Hannah Scheidt,Northwestern University,Illinois,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, I examine authority in contemporary atheism through visual culture. My sources include fan art, cartoons, and Internet memes. This paper therefore adopts a cultural studies approach to contemporary atheism, contributing an understanding of how atheism operates “on the ground” as much more than a simple lack of belief. Much has been made about the works of New Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, but relatively little has been done to analyze how they are consumed and reproduced, interpreted and critiqued, by everyday atheists. I address the tension between contemporary atheists’ skepticism regarding traditional authority and their simultaneous acceptance of some modes and sources of authority. Atheists themselves are aware of this tension, and treat it thoughtfully, playfully, and self-reflexively (jokingly calling Dawkins, for example, the Atheist Pope). I also connect my observations about authority in contemporary atheism with a commentary about gender in today’s atheist network, a subject for which my cultural sources provide rich material. This paper draws from cultural studies, religious studies, media studies, and gender studies in an effort to better understand how atheists builds narratives, community, and culture in deeply complex relationship with their understandings of religion, and not simply in reaction or opposition to religion.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Contested Secularism(s) in Bangladesh,Mascha Schulz,University of Zurich,Switzerland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Secularism and the role of religion in the public sphere in Bangladesh have been highly contested issues in Bangladesh since a long period, but contestation and polarization have regained remarkable intensity in the recent past. In this context also the academic writing on the issue of secularism, national identity and religion in Bangladesh and concomitant conflicts has remerged with new impetus. In this presentation I will explore the light that recent academic writing sheds on contested secularism in Bangladesh. I will summarize the existing literature by pointing to different narratives and motives frequently presented in the literature. This will help us to understand how these contestations around religion and secularism in
Bangladesh are commonly interpreted and how various issues and conflicts are conflated
within these debates. As a second step, I will discuss to which extend the scholarly works
can themselves be considered as part of politics around the contested issue of “secularism”
and the role of religion in Bangladesh. Therefore, I will summarize which implicit or explicit
claims or political statements are made by the authors, and in which ways these statements
relate to the positions of respective authors as well as academia in general.
Further, I would like to contrast the academic discourse concerning issues related to
secularism in Bangladesh to the emerging scholarship that discusses ways of
conceptualizing non-religion and secularism. Consequently, I will use a few selected
approaches to argue that a conversation between both so far largely disconnected corpuses
of scholarship can be of mutual benefit as it allows a critical review of the existing narratives
and debates in both of them. I will conclude my presentation with proposing possible
approaches that will allow us a deeper understanding of the politics of secularism in
Bangladesh. ",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Pathways to Organizational Involvement Among Nonbelievers,Amanda Schutz,University of Arizona,Arizona,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Previous research on non-religion has often sampled for nonbelievers via their connections to nonreligious organizations. Making assumptions about nonbelievers as a whole, then, can problematic, since only a portion of nonbelievers are likely to be involved with such groups. Joining a nonreligious organization satisfies a desire for community for some nonbelievers, but social research has not adequately explained why some nonbelievers join while others do not. If nonbelievers are looking for social interaction, intellectual debate, or secular spiritual fulfillment, they can potentially find it via a nonreligious organization; however, organizational affiliation could be a sufficient but unnecessary means of achieving personal goals. This prompts me to ask, what is the difference between the joining and the non-joining nonbeliever? Have they taken different pathways to non-belief and do they experience nonbelief in significantly different ways? In order to determine why some nonbelievers choose not to participate in collective action, and to assess the actual impact of organizations on those who do, non-joiners should be compared to organization members, who may differ systematically from those who join. To answer these questions I interviewed 125 nonbelievers in Houston, Texas, most of whom were involved to varying degrees with nonreligious organizations, but many that were not. I examined respondents’ religious backgrounds, journeys to non-belief, “coming out” experiences, and organizational affiliations to search for similarities and differences in these two groups of nonbelievers.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.
Failing God? The effects of Church scandals on Catholic belief and affiliation in Ireland,Hugh Turpin,Queen’s University Belfast,Northern Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"I will present on my research into the effects of perceived ‘religious hypocrisy’ on religious belief and affiliation, focusing on the context of contemporary Irish Catholicism. Despite collapses in trust and practice since the promulgation of the clerical sexual abuse scandals from the early 1990s onwards and a swiftly growing minority identifying as non-religious, survey data still return unusually high levels of religious belief and affiliation in Ireland by
European standards, something that has led sociologists to propose that by and large the
Irish population remain ‘believers’ and ‘cultural Catholics’ despite their growing lack of
institutional engagement (Davie, 1994; Donnelly & Inglis, 2009). My research examines the
accuracy of this characterisation utilising a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic
fieldwork undertaken in Dublin with experimental techniques built on a theoretical standpoint
taken from the cognitive science of religion. These experiments aim to directly test whether
religious credence is undermined when cultural learners witness ‘Credibility Undermining
Displays’, namely instances where religious paragons fail to ‘practice what they preach’
(Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012). My presentation will cover the preliminary data yielded by
these experiments, and compliment this with the more nuanced qualitative findings drawn
from my fieldwork and interviews among informants from two Dublin parishes. Together, it is
hoped that these preliminary findings will suggest insights regarding how exactly the
discrediting of the Church relates to contemporary Irish secularisation.",2016,Conference,"Approaching Nonreligion: Conceptual, methodical, and empirical approaches in a new research field",.,.

Early-Modern Irreligion and Theological Analogy: A Response to Gavin Hyman’s A Short History of Atheism,Daniel J. Linford,Thomas Nelson Community College,Virginia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Historically, many Christians have understood God’s transcendence to imply God’s properties categorically differ from any created properties. For multiple historical figures, a problem arose for religious language: how can one talk of God at all if none of our predicates apply to God? What are we to make of creeds and Biblical passages that seem to predicate creaturely properties, such as goodness and wisdom, of God? Thomas Aquinas offered a solution: God is to be spoken of only through analogy (the doctrine of analogy). Gavin Hyman argues Aquinas’s doctrine of analogy was neglected prior to the early-modern period and the neglect of analogy produced the conception of a god vulnerable to atheistic arguments. Contra Hyman, in this paper, I show early-modern atheism arose in a theological context in which there was an active debate concerning analogy. Peter Browne (1665–1735) and William King (1650–1729) offered two competing conceptions of analogical predication that were debated through the 19th century, with interlocutors such as the freethinker Anthony Collins (1676–1729), theologian/philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and skeptic David Hume (1711–1776). Lastly, I discuss the 18th century debate over theological analogy as part of the background relevant to understanding Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.
"Kids, You Make the Choice: Religious and Secular Socialization among Marginal Affiliates and Nonreligious Individuals",Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"What approaches do parents or those who plan to have children employ to socialize their children about religious or secular identification, beliefs, and practices? In what ways do primary and secondary socialization agents interact in this process? How might cultural narratives shape or be shaped by primary and secondary socialization activities? I address these questions by drawing on sixty interviews with two groups of Canadians – those who identify with a Christian group but limit attendance to religious holidays and rites of passage (marginal affiliates), and those who do not identify with any religion and never attend religious services (nonreligious individuals). I found that marginal affiliates did or planned to expose their children to religious belief and practice, while nonreligious individuals were inclined to defer to their children. However, marginal affiliates and nonreligious individuals jointly maintained that children should have choice in this matter. Parents did not or planned not to impose religious or secular views on children. Further, one’s upbringing informed parental socialization strategies and tactics that were largely informed by prevailing Canadian cultural narratives.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.
“They Just Don’t Stand for Nothing”: LGBT Christians’ Definitions of Non-Religious Others,Jason Edward Sumerau,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this exploratory study, I examine how a group of LGBT Christians conceptualized non-religious others. Based on over 450 hours of fieldwork in an LGBT Christian church located in the southeastern region of the United States, I demonstrate how a group of LGBT Christians defined non-religious others as (1) morally suspect and untrustworthy, (2) in need of salvation and guidance, and (3) poor representations of the LGBT community. Although these LGBT Christians used “non-religious” as a catchall term without ever specifying exactly who it captured, they used the first two definitions to apply to non-religious people in general regardless of sexuality while explicitly focusing on non-religious sexual minorities in their third definition. Moreover, I show how these definitions echoed mainstream religious rhetoric in America used to marginalize both sexual and religious minorities. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how religious depictions of non-religious people may reproduce societal patterns of inequality; and (2) the importance of analyzing how religious people define and interpret non-religious others.",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.
Attitudes Towards Spirituality and Other Worldly Experiences: An Online Survey of British Humanists,Simon Dein,Durham University,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This study examined attitudes towards and understandings of the term “spirituality” among members of the British Humanist Association (N = 318). Thirty-five percent agreed strongly and twenty-one percent moderately agreed that it was possible to be spiritual without being religious. Some respondents asserted that the term spiritual was so vague as to be almost useless. They preferred terms such as emotional connectedness, awe, or beauty, which are commonly included in definitions of spirituality. For a few individuals, spirituality referred to the existence of spirits. A minority in the study (12%) had what might be defined as ‘other worldly experiences,’ although these were explained in purely naturalistic terms (e.g., lack of sleep, drugs/alcohol, and brain dysfunction). The primary conclusion from the survey is that many British Humanists see no contradiction between being a humanist and having experiences that are often defined as “spiritual.”",2016,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,5,.

Given the growing recognition of the importance of intersectionality in understanding the experiences of minorities, in this article we examined attitudes toward intersected identities, combining five (non)religious identities (i.e., Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, and nonreligious) with four sexual/gender identities (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender) using a 100-point thermometer scale (N = 618). We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were religious identities, with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non)religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” religious identities, unless those religious identities are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power
"Straight Gods, White Devils: Exploring Paths to Non-Religion in the Lives of Black LGBTQ People",Simone Kolysh,The Graduate Center,New York,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"To examine paths to non-religion in the lives of black LGBTQ people, I analyze 10 interviews of black LGBTQ people who were raised Christian. Utilizing an intersectional lens, I conclude that lessons of the Christian home, reinforced in religious school and at church, drew a connection between Christianity, one’s racial and ethnic identity, and heterosexuality in such a way that being LGBTQ was marked un-Christian and foreign, and sometimes associated with whiteness. This further shaped how my participants navigated the urban public sphere, one of the only spheres where they could ‘be LGBTQ’ – some neighborhoods were constructed as Christian, connected to one’s childhood and hostile to LGBTQ people, while others were LGBTQ-friendly, albeit largely white and gentrified. The overall impact of Christianity across multiple spheres influenced which non-religious paths my participants took. One remained with a Christian denomination of her childhood and one remained with a Christian denomination of her mother but not her father. The other eight left Christianity behind, with one choosing a different religion and seven becoming non-religious, holding identities from Unitarian Universalist to atheist.

Nowakowski,Florida State University,Florida,F,Jason Edward Sumerau,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In this paper, we compute prevalence estimates for nonreligious and religious people in relation to 16 common chronic conditions in contemporary American society. Using survey data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we speak to current debates concerning potential relationships between religion, nonreligion and health in older adult populations with two key findings. First, we show no consistent relationships between religion or nonreligion and chronic condition prevalence. Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i.e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing intersectional approaches to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,Intersectionality and Power
Institutional Confidence in the United States: Attitudes of Secular Americans,Isabella Kasselstrand,California State University,California,F,Tiana Couse,Colorado Mesa University,Colorado,F,Shanell Sanchez,Southern Oregon University,Oregon,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The First Amendment to the United States’ Constitution addresses freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995–2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions. Based on previous literature and the empirical evidence presented in this study, we argue that overall lower levels of institutional confidence among secular Americans is an outcome of the exclusion of such individuals from American social life. Thus, it highlights the importance of addressing the stereotypes and prejudice that this minority group faces.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.
There is a Sexular Body: Introducing a Material Approach to the Secular,Jelle Wiering,University of Groningen,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article calls for more ‘bottom-up inquiry’ into the secular, departing from the assumption that it features normative ideologies and practices that dominate current societies. I plea for collecting and analyzing manifestations of the secular, as the secular as an phenomenon in society is surprisingly unexplored. To stimulate such inquiry, I suggest a material approach to the secular, as it will provide researchers with tools to conduct empirical research on the secular in contemporary societies. Inspired by Joan Scott, Charles Hirschkind, and Talal Asad, this article explores the notion of a Dutch ‘sexular’ body: a body which affective-gestural repertoires, limited here to the context of sexuality, people in society (historically) associate with the secular. I conclude by arguing that a material approach to the secular will contribute to (1) obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the secular, including its cultural conceptualizations and manifestations, and (2) clarifying, and hence facing the normativity the secular imposes on the people living in secular societies.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.

Using a jurisdictional scan, focus groups, and an on-line survey, this exploratory survey examines the provision for and use of secular legal marriage in Canada’s regions from a humanist perspective. It is postulated that marriage ceremonies have persisted among the non-religious due to needs to authenticate or recognize transitional changes to the self, but these needs have been met through ad hoc strategies as opposed to a uniform demand for humanist services. Implications for humanist organizations are discussed along with recommendations for further research.",2017,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,6,.

Social Imaginaries in a Globalizing World ,Hans Alma,Utrecht University,Netherlands,M,Guido Vanheeswijck,University of Antwerp,Belgium,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"How to study the contemporary dynamics between the religious, the nonreligious and the secular in a globalizing world? Obviously, their relationship is not an empirical datum, liable to the procedures of verification or of logical deduction. We are in need of alternative conceptual and methodological tools. This volume argues that the concept of ‘social imaginary’ as it is used by Charles Taylor, is of utmost importance as a methodological tool to understand these dynamics. The first section is dedicated to the conceptual clarification of Taylor’s notion of social imaginaries both through a historical study of their genealogy and through conceptual analysis. In the second section, we clarify the relation of ‘social imaginaries’ to the concept of (religious) worldviewing, understood as a process of truth seeking. Furthermore, we discuss the practical usefulness of the concept of social imaginaries for cultural scientists, by focusing on the concept of human rights as a secular social imaginary. In the third and final section, we relate Taylor’s view on the role of social imaginaries and the new paths it opens up for religious studies to other analyses of the secular-religious divide, as they nowadays mainly come to the fore in the debates on what is coined as the ‘post-secular.’",2018,Book,"Religion and its others: Studies in Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity",.,.

"Stigmatization and Validation of Atheism, Literalism, and Non-Literalism in the Discourse over Evolutionary Theory",Eric O. Silva,Georgia Southern University,Georgia,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article explores how atheism, literalism, and non-literalism are validated and stigmatized in public discourse over evolutionary theory. Through an ethnographic content analysis of 1,028 letters to the editor, I examine how authors frame the relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and religious faith. I find there are four ways of doing so: 1) implicit polarization, obliquely denies any compatibility between religion and evolution; 2) distancing, separates one’s position from that of another; 3) articulation, weaves evolution and faith together; and 4) combinations of polarization, distancing, and articulation. Each framing results in some mixture of stigmatization and validation of atheism, literalism, and non-literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes and validates atheism and literalism. Implicit polarization stigmatizes non-literalism through unacknowledgment. Distancing can validate and stigmatize literalism and non-literalism, while it also results in literalism and atheism being stigmatized by putative allies. Articulation validates non-literalism by representing it in the public sphere and it stigmatizes atheism and literalism through unacknowledgment.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.
Sovereign of Herself: Women’s Narratives of ‘Lived Atheism’,Marta Trzebiatowska,University of Aberdeen,Scotland,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"In most western societies the number of female non-believers is growing and atheism has become one manifestation of nonreligion among many (Pew Forum, 2015). However, little is known about female atheists. This article fills the gap by providing the voices of a small percentage of women who consider themselves ‘practising’ but not ‘active’ atheists. Through a sociological analysis of qualitative interviews with twenty self-identified atheist women I argue for the importance of researching the mundane aspects of female atheism which often fall under the radar when scholars focus predominantly on the vocal and politically active atheists. ‘Lived atheism’ comprises small and seemingly insignificant actions and utterances which structure atheist women’s lives and contribute to the creation of new worldviews, symbols, and reflexive strategies. Micro-actions triggered by religious content, symbols and utterances, found in the nominally secular fabric of everyday life, add up to novel forms of gendered agency which is markedly different to outspoken activist atheism, and yet not the same as agnosticism, pure indifference, or ‘none-ism’. By examining ‘atheist flashpoints’ – moments when dormant atheist convictions come to the surface – I demonstrate how women practice ‘everyday atheism’ as they navigate personal and public spaces.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.
Reframing Secularist Premises: Divorce among Traditionalist Muslim and Jewish Women within the Secular State,Pascale Fourier,University of Ottawa,Canada,M,Jacques Berlinerblau,Georgetown University,Washington,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in scholarly attention to the subject of secularism. This body of work, theoretical and normative in nature, rarely addresses ethnographic data and the lived experiences of situated agents. Starting with a review of three major theoretical approaches to the study of secularism (i.e., the writings of the 19th century Freethinker George Jacob Holyoake, the research of scholars who work in post-Foucauldian traditions, and those beholden to more traditional liberal political assumptions), we ask how each of these theories interfaces with our own ethnographic discoveries. Our interviews with traditionalist Jewish and Muslim women seeking divorces in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, challenge and complexify many of the assumptions that undergird each of the aforementioned theoretical schools. Our ethnography reveals interesting and unexpected patterns of women’s agency, religious critique, and navigation of parallel civil and religious structures.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.
"“A Swedish Voltaire” The Life and Afterlife of Ingemar Hedenius, 20th-Century Atheist",Anton Jansson,University of Gothenburg,Sweden,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Ingemar Hedenius (1908–1982) was a professor of philosophy, and one of Sweden’s most famous public intellectuals in the decades following the Second World War. This was primarily due to his 1949 work Tro och vetande (English: Belief and Knowledge) in which he criticized religion, and his subsequent activity in the promotion of atheism and criticism of the relationship between church and state. This article engages with Hedenius’s life and works, but has a particular focus on his “afterlife”. The article utilizes theories of cultural memory to examine how Hedenius has been remembered since his death. I argue that Hedenius and his Tro och vetande in Sweden have taken the role of a node, or inescapable orientation point, of discussions of atheism, belief and knowledge, and the validity of Christian truths. Hedenius’s memory continues to loom large over religion and nonreligion in Sweden to this day. The material used as primary sources in this article include scholarly works of philosophy, theology and history, by renowned Swedish academics, but it also contains interpretations of Hedenius in the wider public debate, not least as expressed by the Swedish Humanist Association, who regard him as a main inspiration for their activities.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"

Only recently has non-belief in God become a central topic in the field. And while it remains an open question whether or not the research assumptions and theoretical frameworks designed for Western populations of Protestants can be applied to non-believers, exploring non-belief in the Islamic context may pose additional problems. For example, do Western concepts and terms such as “church attendance” or “atheist” have equivalent meaning in the Muslim world? Are there any structural differences within Islam and Christianity that may contribute to the uneven number of self-reported non-believers within these cultures? In this article, we argue that a cultural psychological approach can provide a useful perspective for researching non-belief in the Muslim cultural context.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.
Increased Wellbeing from Social Interaction in a Secular Congregation,Michael E. Price,Brunel University London,England,M,Jacques Launay,Brunel University London,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Religiosity appears to benefit wellbeing, potentially due to social support offered by religious communities. However, rising secularism implies that fewer people have access to these benefits. To address this problem, we investigated whether these benefits could also be obtained from membership in a secular, quasi-religious community. We conducted a longitudinal study among 92 members of the Sunday Assembly (SA), an international organization of secular congregations. SA members assemble in large services and in smaller interest groups that offer more face-to-face interaction. Once a month for six months, participants completed a questionnaire measuring wellbeing and participation in both SA and non-SA social activities. Panel analysis of longitudinal data revealed that participation in SA small-group activities positively influenced wellbeing over the six-month period, particularly among males. Participation in non-SA social activities, in contrast, had no effect on wellbeing. Aspects of the Sunday service that members perceived as most important, both for creating a sense of community and for friendship formation, were the informal socialising and cooperating that occurs before and after the service itself. Secular congregations may be a viable alternative for non-religious people (and perhaps especially men) who seek the health benefits that religious communities have traditionally offered.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,.
Yamagata Bantō: An Atheist in the Tokugawa Period,Shuhei Fujii,University of Tokyo,Japan,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This paper will discuss the atheistic thought of Yamagata Bantō (1748–1821). The general concept of atheism will also be discussed. The term “atheism” is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Bantō, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603–1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Bantō denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Bantō, gods were a “skillful means” created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Bantō believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Bantō, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Bantō’s “no gods” argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Bantō is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Bantō will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of “atheism” and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"

Various forms of nonreligion have been studied extensively in recent years, yet mostly in the contemporary Western societies. This article shifts the context more to the east and also towards the history by comparing two instances when meaning-making gained a central position within an atheist tradition. For our first example, we examine the appeal to spirituality in the period of late Soviet atheism; the second comes from contemporary Western “atheist spirituality”. By studying the publications by relevant authors, the article explores what can be learned about atheism and spirituality from this comparison, how atheism and spirituality are understood and combined, and the reasons for the sudden emphasis on existential questions within an atheist tradition.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"
What is Nonreligion? On the Virtues of a Meaning Systems Framework for Studying Nonreligious and Religious Worldviews in the Context of Everyday Life,Ann Taves,University of California at Santa Barbara,California,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Discussions of nonreligion or secularity face a central challenge that has long plagued scholars of religion – that of specifying an object of study. Although several suggestions have been made, I think we can most effectively capture the range of things we want to study by (1) adopting worldviews, defined in terms of “big questions,” as an overarching rubric that encompasses both religious and nonreligious outlooks and (2) nuancing our understanding of worldviews in light of the meaning systems (MS) framework, already in use in psychology. Doing so relieves scholars of the obligation of defining religion and nonreligion and allows us to focus on how individuals and groups characterize themselves. It provides a neutral starting point for analyzing worldviews that is not biased toward religion, and, in so far as a case can be made that all humans must address these questions at least implicitly, it offers a basis for comparison across cultures. The so-called “existentially indifferent” provide a challenge in this regard and allow us to consider the value of an evolutionary perspective on meaning making.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion
Activist Unbelief in Canadian History,Elliot Hanowski,Independent scholar,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Canada has a long history of religious unbelief. This paper offers a social historical survey of its organized, activist forms. The radical thought of the Enlightenment was imported in the late eighteenth century, which saw Voltairean deists like Fleury Mesplet criticizing the Catholic Church in the French-speaking colony of Lower Canada. A long tradition of anticlericalism followed in Quebec even though (or because) the Church was massively influential. The rest of Canada saw freethought and rationalist movements, often organized by working-class autodidacts, developing in the nineteenth century with American and British influences. This tradition continued into the first half of the twentieth century when secularists grappled with fundamentalism and the challenge of radical politics. After World War II the language of secular humanism was deployed and organizations were run by highly educated professionals instead. The position of activist unbelief began to change as Canada shifted from being one of the Western world’s most religious countries to being one of the least in the latter half of the twentieth century. Unbelief became unremarkable, though the persistence of religion meant that the twenty-first century saw a revival of militant atheism. This survey shows that unbelief was never just a pure philosophical position but has always been shaped by the social status quo it evolved in or was opposing. Nor was opposition ever enough; activist unbelievers inevitably had to offer the undecided a vision of the secular world they were working towards, and this meant getting involved in some form of politics.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"
An Argument for Unbelief: A Discussion about Terminology,Nickolas Garth Conrad,University of California,California,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The rupture with traditional religion and the loss of belief in God as a widespread religious position represents a sea change in Western thought. However, there were very few self-declared atheists, secularists, and humanists in Western history prior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even during the Modern period, there are not many. This is especially true in my own research of nineteenth and early twentieth-century France. Those who took the name of atheist such as Baron d’Holbach or Jacques-André Naigeon were exceptional militants. The quest to find other such atheists buried in the pages and hidden messages of key books is a limited endeavor. Atheism as a concept does not originate from any single creed or doctrine and is itself open to permutation. Looking for a clear and distinct form of atheism is looking for a conceptual phenomenon constructed by the researcher. The language and words we use control and direct how we understand the past. The term “atheist” imposes a rigidity to a fluid and shifting phenomenon. Instead, we should open up our research to the emergence of modern “unbelief,” as defined by Gordon Stein and Tom Flynn in The Encyclopedia of Unbelief. This paper will argue for “unbelief” as the proper analytical category as a field of future research that will allow for a much larger, more inclusive, variegated set of parameters to understand the rupture with traditional forms of religion or spiritual practices. The important change in intellectual history was not the emergence of a particular atheism that promoted scientism and which held to its positions dogmatically but the acute doubt of past intellectual and religious traditions that led to a spectrum of new ideologies and religious positions.",2018,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,7,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"

"Grounding Non-Theological Morality: The Victorian Secularist Movement, Secular Ethics, and Human Progress",Patrick John Corbeil,Saint Mary’s University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This article examines the formation of British Secularist ethics in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The Secularist movement, initiated by George Jacob Holyoake in 1851, was a primarily artisan working-class social movement that sought to ground social ethics upon a rational, scientific, and non-theological foundation. This article examines how the quest for a science of morals informed Secularist expectations and judgements. In this article, I trace how the idea of a rational science of ethics was integrated into the secularist movement. I begin by briefly situating the Secularist movement within the wider moral and epistemological debates of the mid-Victorian period. I address the implications that atheism had on the development of Secularism, and on its contemporary reputation and respectability. I then examine how Holyoake sought to establish the non-theological grounds of morality and the tensions that arose from debates between Secularists regarding the necessity of atheism to Secularism. Finally, I argue that despite significant fissures within the movement created by the question of the necessity of atheism, Secularism nevertheless evinced a high degree of conceptual unity concerning the nature and grounds of morality.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,"Histories of Atheism, Secularism, and Humanism: Exploring the State of the Field"
On Learning from the Margins: Jewish Nonreligious Grammars within a Secular-Protestant Landscape,Ruth Sheldon,King’s College London,England,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This contribution to the special issue draws on ethnographic fieldwork exploring pluralities of Jewish life across adjacent urban neighbourhoods in London in order to engage with the conceptual questions and empirical omissions that are currently of concern to scholars of nonreligion. Learning from some illustrative moments in my fieldwork in which articulations of non-belief in God serendipitously arose, I first consider how marginal Jewish perspectives trouble the conceptual framing of ‘religion/nonreligion’ within (post)Protestant cultures. I then show how an ethnographic approach focused on the specific contexts in which piety or belief in God is othered can deepen understanding of the heterogeneous formations of ‘nonreligion’, even within relatively well-researched settings such as contemporary London.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion
Angels and the Digital Afterlife: Death and Nonreligion Online,Tim Hutchings,University of Nottingham,England,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"This brief article aims to draw the attention of nonreligion researchers to a growing interdisciplinary research field: the study of death online. In digitally networked societies, the dead are remembered online, and their survivors can use digital resources to express grief, find support and construct memorials. New norms and languages of mourning are emerging, including new references to heaven, angels and communication with the dead. The boundary between religion and nonreligion is blurred in these new practices, but we know very little as yet about what this blurring actually means to the bereaved. This article will outline the main approaches to religion in studies of death online, draw on nonreligion research to critique these approaches, and call for new directions and methods in future studies of nonreligion and media. It will argue that scholars of religion and nonreligion have much to offer to the study of death online, and this article acts as an introduction and an invitation to future interdisciplinary exploration.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion
Questions You Should Never Ask an Atheist: Towards Better Measures of Nonreligion and Secularity,Ryan T. Cragun,University of Tampa,Florida,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"As interest in the nonreligious has grown, attention has turned to how to measure both the growth of and variation within the nonreligious. This interest has also revealed that prior measures of religiosity are often problematic. In this research note, I detail some of these problems. For instance, some measures fail to contrast nonreligiosity with religiosity. Other measures are double-barreled or one-and-a-half barreled, making them impossible for nonreligious individuals to answer. Finally, I note that how questions are worded can result in very different estimates of how many nonreligious people and atheists there are in a population.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,Methods for the Scientific Study of Nonreligion
"Politics, Individualism, and Atheism: An Examination of the Political Attitudes of Atheist Activists in a Canadian City",Jonathan S. Simmons,University of Alberta,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Given the growth of atheism in the Western world (including activist organizations), and atheists becoming more political, it is essential to understand the identities and values that motivate atheist activism. One avenue for exploring these identities and values is through an examination of individual political attitudes. Although the scholarship on atheist activists’ political attitudes is limited, some scholars have identified the apparent growth of right-wing sentiments within the US atheist movement (LeDrew 2016). Others have identified a contentious relationship between prominent atheists’ political attitudes and egalitarian views (e.g., anti-sexism and anti-racism) (Amarasingam, Amarnath, and Brewster 2016). Of those scholars who have commented on atheists’ viewpoints, most emphasize the liberalism of the broader population of atheists. The purpose of this article is to examine the political attitudes of atheist activists in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and highlight a core set of political attitudes and values that atheists share despite intra-movement disagreements about the relationship between atheist identity and political ideology. My findings show that some Canadian atheist activists’ share a cluster of liberal and Enlightenment ideals that includes personal liberty, individualism, and an absolutist view of free expression. This article will be of interest to scholars of atheist activism as well as social movement scholars.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.
How Do Religious People Become Atheists? Applying a Grounded Theory Approach to Propose a Model of Deconversion,Sergio Perez,Trinity College Dublin,Ireland,M,Frédérique Vallières,Trinity College Dublin,Ireland,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The influence of organized religion is decreasing in the West, and trends show a growing number of people abandoning their religious beliefs, or deconverting. However, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention in the psychology of religion. The current study asks “How do religious people become atheists?” and aims to further the understanding of the process of religious deconversion by offering a proposed model of deconversion. The main findings within the literature are examined, and consideration is given to the concept of deconversion itself and to biases within the psychology of religion. Employing an inductive grounded theory approach based on Strauss and Corbin’s guidelines, we investigated the process of deconversion among a sample of atheist individuals who previously identified as religious. The data consists of 30 testimonies obtained from former clergypersons and six semi-structured interviews with atheist participants recruited through an advocacy group. The resulting model of deconversion is comprised of three core categories: reason and enquiry, criticism and discontent, and personal development. Despite being closely interlinked, these categories were clearly distinct and represent an intellectual impetus, moral and ethical judgments of religion, and overcoming personal issues, respectively. For all participants deconversion developed gradually within the close context of family and local community and the wider cultural context of society at large. Findings are discussed in relation to previous research and psychological theory.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.
Social Class and the Stubbornness of Family Myths: How Nonbeliever and Pagan Parents Cope with Intrusions on Parenting by Proselytizing Christian Family Members in the U.S. Bible Belt,Amy I. McClure,Rollins College,Florida,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Family scholars have documented how powerful institutions intrude upon marginalized parents. Yet, few have examined the effect that intrusion on parenting takes on a more intimate level. Guided by insights from theories of emotion management and family inequality, I compare how two religiously marginalized groups in the Bible Belt cope with a ubiquitous experience they face as parents—unwelcomed proselytizing by Christian family members. Based on participant-observation and forty in-depth interviews, I document nonbeliever and Pagan parents’ experiences with proselytizing by Christian family members to be common, intrusive, and often perceived as potentially harmful to children. Failing to enforce desired boundaries between children and proselytizers, many parents resort to constructing narratives of equality to describe a condition of inequality. They do so by claiming a “we just don’t talk about religion” arrangement. This narrative, though seemingly equitable, serves as a family myth, obscuring painful truths about power and inequality. Nonbeliever and Pagan parents differ in their reliance on this rhetoric. While nonbeliever parents cling to the family myth as an emotion management device, Pagans more readily acknowledge the “we just don’t talk about religion” strategy as more fiction than fact. I analyze how differences in social class explain nonbelievers’ and Pagans’ differing levels of commitment to this family myth. I place this phenomenon within the culture of Christian hegemony in the Bible Belt, where proselytizing is normative and prevailing norms of privatization within parenting are overridden by a culture of evangelism.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.
"Atheism, Social Networks and Health: A Review and Theoretical Model",Kevin McCaffree,University of North Texas,Texas,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Despite accumulating evidence of the importance of social capital in predicting health outcomes, no work has yet systematically investigated the structural differences between the social networks of god-believers and atheists. This is an especially important gap in the religion/secularism research because religiosity appears to be declining throughout the Western world (Zuckerman, Galen & Pasquale, 2016). Despite stereotypes of atheists as atomized, psychologically unhealthy and anti-social (e.g., Bainbridge, 2005), a growing body of evidence suggests that strongly-identified atheists are more likely to join secular social clubs as well as benefit from better mental and physical health compared to less affirmatively-identified secular individuals. As a step toward developing this line of research, the present article operationalizes social network structure within the study of secularism, discusses the available research with a focus on atheism in particular, and integrates this research into a schematic theoretical model of atheist self-identity, network structure and health.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.
Cohesiveness of Group Identity and Characterizations of the Out-Group among Atheist and Christian Student Clubs,Joshua Doyle,Duke University,North Carolina,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Do social groups that have a strong ideological basis tend to form a cohesive group identity among group members? This paper investigates how negatively defining an out-group is important, if not integral, for creating a shared identity among members of ideologically based social groups. To explore this connection, I interviewed undergraduate student members of a Christian club and an atheist club at a Midwestern research university. I examined the strength of group identification, how members revealed shared identity, and patterns regarding how participants characterize out-group members. My findings suggest that atheists characterized Christians as less rational and in need of external comfort more than themselves, whereas Christians described atheists as disturbed by suffering and the behavior of some self-identified Christians. Defining one’s in-group and reaffirming the correctness and inherent social benefit of the in-group’s views were essential components of out-group characterizations.",2019,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,8,.
"Going Godless: Black Feminism, Humanism, and Anti-Racism",Sikivu Hutchinson,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"According to a 2012 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation Survey, 87% of African American women are religious, making African American women among the most religious demographic groups in the U.S. Although Black women have long been stereotyped as the “backbone” of the Black Church, some Black women non-theists and humanists are bucking these traditions to challenge organized religion. Historically, Black women have relied on churches and faith-based institutions as vehicles for political organizing, cultural identity, and community solidarity. It is for this reason, as well as the slave-era stigma associated with Black female sexuality, that being a Black female humanist and atheist is even more taboo than being a Black male atheist. Dehumanized as either hyper-sexual Jezebels or asexual Aunt Jemimas, Black women have been constructed as less moral, less human, less chaste, and less civilized than respectable white Christian women. “Going Godless” will examine this history vis-à-vis the emergence of Black feminist humanist perspectives in the American secular humanist and atheist movements. For example, how have Black women humanists and atheists drawn on the feminist/womanist legacy of writers and thinkers like Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Nella Larsen? How are they challenging the traditional church/state separation agenda of the mainstream atheist/humanist movements? And what intersectional issues inform a Black feminist humanist political agenda as racial, gender, and socioeconomic inequality intensifies in the U.S.?",2020,Annual lecture,NSRN Annual Lecture(s),.,.

The Meaning of ‘Secular’ as a Scientific Concept,John Shook,University at Buffalo,New York,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"The meaning of ‘secular’ in the scientific use of ‘secular trend’, ‘secular variation’, and similar terms is a topic that merits historical investigation. The scientific meaning for ‘secular’ has an origin and independent role apart from both religion and secularization. Fields in the social sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences have been using the concepts of ‘secular trend’ and ‘secular variation’ for almost two centuries. The field of economics was the first among the social sciences, while epidemiology was the first in the life sciences. Both disciplines adapted the use of ‘secular trend’ and ‘secular variation’ from the earth sciences, which borrowed the idea of ‘secular’ from astronomy. Early astronomical texts first used ‘secular’ to describe ‘secular inequalities’ and ‘secular variations’ in long-term patterns to celestial motions. Astronomers had found saeculum to be a convenient Latin word from ancient Rome to refer to a century’s duration. This article recounts the intellectual history of the scientific uses, which continue to lack a relationship with anything religious to the present day.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
Religious Socialization and Millennial Involvement in Organized and Digital Nonbelief Activities,Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme,University of Waterloo,Canada,F,Joel Thiessen,Ambrose University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Drawing on a representative survey sample of just over 2,500 young adult respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 from across the USA and Canada, our study seeks to understand who exactly takes part in organized and digital nonbelief activities. Our findings show that (a) there is a positive association between religious childhood socialization and the likelihood of being involved with organized and digital atheist, humanist and secularist activities among young adult nonbelievers; (b) there is a positive link between involvement in organized and digital nonbelief activities and those who experience discrimination due to their nonbelief, mediating the religious childhood socialization association (subcultural identity theory); and (c) there is a remaining positive direct relationship between religious childhood socialization and involvement in organized and digital nonbelief activities as individuals seek to retain some vestiges of religious life among these nonreligious groups (vestiges of religious life theory). We additionally demonstrate that, while fewer than half of nonbelieving Millennials are involved in organized or digital nonbelief settings, those in the USA are more likely to be involved than in Canada. Moreover, in both nations, those who are involved tend to be more engaged in online settings versus in-person contexts.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
Imaginary Friends and Made-Up Stories: How to Explore (Non)Religious Imaginaries Without Asking Belief-Centred Questions,Timothy Stacey,Leiden University,Netherlands,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Abby Day transformed research into nonreligion by demonstrating how to talk about belief without asking religious questions. This article aims to go a step further by demonstrating a way of exploring (non)religious imaginaries without asking belief-centred questions. It does so by suggesting that researchers 1) ask what people are willing to commit their precious time to doing and subsequently 2) pay attention to the myths they tell in sustaining these actions and the way that the imagination brings these to life. I suggest that asking people what they believe may force them into a response that forecloses the complexity of their imagination. Focusing on the belief-based distinctions between purportedly ‘religious’ and ‘nonreligious’ people as has proved particularly popular in the psychology of religion reproduces a (post)Protestant understanding of religion as deeply held belief. Recent developments in sociology and anthropology suggest that this is an inaccurate understanding of many religious people. I suggest that it also places conceptual constraints on explorations of nonreligious imaginaries. Perhaps it does not matter whether people believe that a literary figure really existed or whether or not people believe in life after death. Instead what matters is the agentive force the characters they are imagining have over their lives.,2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
Beneath the Surface: A Critique of the Common Survey Model in the Study of Nonreligion,Elisa Järnefelt,Independent scholar,United States,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"When measuring nonreligiosity, a common approach is to ask about the participants’ religious or nonreligious affiliation and belief in God. In this critical commentary, this type of methodological approach – referred as the “survey model” – is first placed in its historical context. The article suggests that understanding the historical context and cultural function of the survey model illuminates various theoretical and methodological limitations that have been previously recognized in multiple areas of research from the study of religion and sociology to survey methodology and cognitive sciences. Based on this interdisciplinary review, it is noted that, if relying on the survey model in either qualitative or quantitative research, the studies are likely to sustain the cultural categories of “religion” and “nonreligion” that, paradoxically, are implicitly defined by the survey model, and remain at the level of reputation management. To overcome these limitations and allowing researchers to assess cultural and cognitive aspects of the forming and construing of a human phenomenon like nonreligiosity, the article emphasizes the importance of multimethodology along with an interdisciplinary theoretical framework.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
The Political Divide Between Lay and Elite Atheism,Richard Cimino,State University of New York-Old Westbury,New York,M,Christopher Smith,Independent scholar,United States,M,Gerrit Cziehso,University of Muenster,Germany,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"A long-standing debate in atheist and secular humanist circles has been whether organized secularists should embrace a broader political agenda or steer clear of such commitments. The latter camp argues that atheism does not include a set of socio-political markers that sets it off from other movements; it is mainly a science- and reason-based philosophy challenging belief in the supernatural that can be adapted to a wide range of political orientations. We find this view increasingly reflected among both atheist and secular humanist leaders and publications, especially in the “new atheist” movement, which has drawn high proportions of atheists interested in science. In this paper, we will examine the political discourse and views of atheist leaders and opinion-makers and those of members of atheist-secular humanist organizations during and after the 2016 elections. We conduct a textual analysis of secularist publications and web sites as well as use a survey we conducted among 3,000 members of a prominent atheist organization to understand the political divide in American secularism and the prospects for greater unity in this diffuse movement.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
Post-Supernatural Cultures: There and Back Again,Wesley J. Wildman,Boston University,Massachusetts,M,F. LeRon Shults,University of Agder,Norway,M,Saikou Y. Diallo,"Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center",Virginia,M,Ross Gore,"Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center",Virginia,M,Justin Lane,University of Oxford,England,M,"The abandonment of supernatural religious beliefs and rituals seems to occur quite easily in some contexts, but post-supernaturalist cultures require a specific set of conditions that are difficult to produce and sustain on a large scale and thus are historically rare. Despite the worldwide resurgence of supernaturalist religion, some subcultures reliably produce people who deny the existence of supernatural entities. This social phenomenon has evoked competing explanations, many of which enjoy empirical support. We synthesize six of the most influential social-science explanations, demonstrating that they provide complementary perspectives on a complex causal architecture. We incorporate this theoretical synthesis into a computer simulation, identifying conditions under which the predominant attitude toward supernaturalism in a population shifts from acceptance to rejection (and vice versa). The model suggests that the conditions for producing widespread rejection of supernatural worldviews are highly specific and difficult to produce and sustain. When those conditions combine, which is historically rare, a stable social equilibrium emerges within which post-supernaturalist worldviews are widespread; however, this equilibrium is easier to disrupt than equilibria whose cohesion is stabilized by supernatural religion due to persistent cognitive tendencies toward supernaturalism in evolved human minds.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
The Final Sentence of Section #151 in Adorno’s Minima Moralia,Nick Overduin,Trent University,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Adorno’s post-World War II statement that ‘No spirit exists’, posited at the conclusion of an essay, provides a crucial window into considerations of modern atheism as well as contemporary anatheism. His utterance occurs historically about half-way between Nietzsche’s infamous declaration of the death of God and these two modern phenomena. His short sentence draws some of its meaning from its immediate context (his essay against occultism), but also from its broader context, the Hegelian notion of the World Spirit. Most significantly, though, it is a highly prescient insight, baldly formulated, and arguably more far-reaching than the madman’s ‘God is dead.’ References are made to various thinkers in the past two hundred years to elucidate some of the possible nuances of Adorno’s statement. Both modern atheism and contemporary anatheism can be illuminated as pivoting around Adorno’s shrewd observation.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
The Arbiters of Faith: Legislative Assembly of BC Entanglement with Religious Dogma Resulting from Legislative Prayer,Ian Bushfield,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,Teale N. Phelps Bondaroff,BC Humanist Association,Canada,M,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Daily sittings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (BC), Canada begin with a prayer or reflection delivered by a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). MLAs have the option of using a sample prayer from a list of five provided by Legislative staff, or of delivering a prayer of their own devising. The Office of the Clerk is currently revising the list of sample prayers to include a greater diversity of beliefs. To accomplish this task, bureaucrats face a number of practical and constitutional challenges. This article explores these challenges. The Office of the Clerk will have to first identify religious and belief groups that are present in BC, then select a reasonable number of those groups to include on the list, and finally identify prayers and reflections that are representative of those traditions. Each of these steps raises practical questions with respect to how bureaucrats can actually make these decisions, and to more fundamental questions regarding the appropriateness of the decisions made. Given these challenges, this paper concludes that the practice of offering sample prayers should be avoided, and that MLAs should be called upon to deliver prayers and reflections of their own devising, or that legislative prayer be abolished.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
Finding the Missing Atheists,Ryan Burge,Eastern Illinois University,Illinois,M,Hannah Smothers,Eastern Illinois University,Illinois,F,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"Anyone who has ever written and distributed a survey knows that the process can oftentimes be drawn out and incredibly tedious. It is almost inevitable that the survey author will realize that they forgot to ask about a specific topic, did not offer enough response options, or did not fully investigate a possible question ordering effect. However, oftentimes these oversights can be seen as opportunities. In the 2010 wave of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, when individuals were asked about their present religion, the response options did not include a choice for atheists, which is present in all other waves of the CCES. If an atheist was taking the questionnaire in 2010 and did not see the optimal choice that described their religious affiliation, what was their backup option? Using both descriptive analysis and machine learning techniques, we try to determine where these misplaced atheists went in the 2010 CCES. In general, we found that the vast majority chose one of the other religiously unaffiliated options: agnostics or nothing in particular, but a significant minority chose another religious tradition. We believe that these results help illuminate how atheists think about their religious affiliation and give researchers more insight into the religious landscape of the United States.",2020,Journal,Secularism & Nonreligion,9,.
